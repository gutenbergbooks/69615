<p class="drop-cap">THIS little book is an attempt to trace, in as
clear and summary a form as possible, the
origin and growth of King Arthur’s historical and
literary renown, and follows, largely, the lines of
a chapter contributed by me to the first volume
of <i>The Cambridge History of English Literature</i>.
Although I have had, necessarily, to refer to much
literary matter which is purely mythological, I
have not sought to give any account of the speculations
of those who in our own time have endeavoured
to reconstruct and interpret the myths and beliefs
of pre-historic Celtic heathendom. Nor have I
made more than the briefest allusion to the subsidiary
legends which, mainly through the agency of French
romantic scribes, came to be associated with Arthur’s
name, and to be included in “the matter of Britain”
as it emerged out of the age of high romance. The
book deals, all but exclusively, with King Arthur
himself, as he is known to chroniclers, romancers
and poets.</p>

<p>My obligations to particular writers will be found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[vi]</span>
recorded in the paginal notes. I must, however,
express here my special indebtedness to the writings
of Sir John Rhys and the late Mr Alfred Nutt. To
Mr Nutt, in particular, whose tragic and untimely
death last year was a grievous loss to Celtic scholarship,
I owe much private help and suggestion.</p>

<p>In one or two chapters of the book—the second
and the third, more especially—I have reproduced,
almost <i>verbatim</i>, a few short passages from articles
of mine which have appeared in <i>The Quarterly
Review</i>, and in the Transactions of the London
Cymmrodorion Society.</p>

<p class="ph2">KING ARTHUR IN HISTORY<br>
AND LEGEND</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">INTRODUCTORY</h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">It</span> is notoriously known through the universal
world,” writes Caxton in his preface to Malory’s
<i>Morte Darthur</i>, “that there be nine worthy” kings
“and the best that ever were,” and that the “first
and chief of the three best Christian and worthy”
is King Arthur. Caxton, however, finds it a matter
of reproach that so little had been done in his own
country to perpetuate and honour the memory
of one who “ought most to be remembered amongst
us Englishmen tofore all other Christian kings.”
Thanks mainly to Caxton’s own enterprise, and to
the poets who have drawn their inspiration from
Malory’s book, there is no longer any cause to accuse
Englishmen of indifference to Arthur’s name and
fame. No literary matter is more familiar to them
than “what resounds in fable or romance of Uther’s
son.” And yet nothing is more “notoriously
known” than that authentic historical records of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
career of this “most renowned Christian king”
are distressingly scanty and indeterminate. An old
Welsh bard, who sings of the graves of departed
British warriors, and has no difficulty in locating
most of them,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> tells us that “unknown is the grave
of Arthur.”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Would that this were indeed the sum
of our ignorance! To-day, as of old, Arthur remains
but a shadowy apparition, clothed in the mists
of legend and stalking athwart the path of history
to distract and mystify the sober chronicler. A
Melchisedec of profane history, he has “neither
beginning of days nor end of life.” Neither date nor
place of birth can be assigned to him any more than
a place of burial, while undiscovered yet is the seat
of that court where knights, only less famous than
himself, sought his benison and behest. It is only
romantic story-tellers, like the authors of the Welsh
<i>Mabinogion</i>, who venture upon such positive statements
as that “Arthur used to hold his court at
Caerlleon upon Usk.”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Geoffrey of Monmouth is,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
indeed, even more precise and circumstantial than
the professed retailers of legend, for he actually
gives the reasons why Arthur settled his court at
Caerlleon, or the City of Legions—a “passing
pleasant place.”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> That, of course, is only Geoffrey’s
way, and illustrates the genius for invention which
makes his so-called <i>History</i> a work unique of its
kind. The “matter of Britain” is, much more than
the “matter of France,” or even the heterogeneous
“matter of Rome the great,” the despair of
the historian.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> But it is, for that very reason, the
paradise of the makers and students of romance;
and, as a result, the mass of Arthurian literature of
all kinds which exists to-day,—prose and verse
romances, critical studies of “origins,” scholarly
quests along perilous paths of mythology and folk-lore,—is
ponderous enough to appal the most
omnivorous reader. The Arthurian legend has
indeed been of late, both in Europe and in America,
the subject of so much mythological, ethnological
and philological speculation as to tempt the unsophisticated
lover of mere literature to say, when he
contemplates the mounting pile of printed critical
matter, that Arthur’s sepulchre, wherever his mortal
remains may lie, is at last well on the way to be
built in our libraries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>There is nothing in literary history quite like the
fascination which Arthurian romance has had for
so many diverse types of mind. Poets, musicians,
painters, religious mystics, folk-lorists, philologists—all
have yielded to it. For some people the study of
Arthurian nomenclature is as engrossing a pursuit
as the interpretation of ‘The Idylls of the King’ is
for others, while there are those who derive as much
pleasure from investigating the symbolic meanings
of the story of the Grail as lovers of music do from
listening to the mighty harmonies of <i>Parzival</i> or
<i>Tristan und Isolde</i>. All this only makes us wonder
the more why so obscure and elusive a figure as
the historical British Arthur should have become
the centre of a romantic cycle which presents so
many varied and persistent features of interest.
Even in Caxton’s time, as in our own, there were
sceptics “who held opinion that there was no such
Arthur, and that all books as been made of him be
but feigned and fables.” This is not surprising,
when it is remembered that even when Geoffrey of
Monmouth, some three centuries before, gave to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
world his astonishing record of Arthur’s achievements,
a few obstinate critics had their doubts about
the whole matter, and one of them—the chronicler,
William of Newburgh—roundly denounced Geoffrey
for having, by his “saucy and shameless lies,” made
“the little finger of his Arthur bigger than the back
of Alexander the Great.”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Caxton’s way with the
sceptics is ingenuous and short, but it is curious to
note how his preface to the <i>Morte Darthur</i> succeeds,
in its own quaint and crude fashion, in suggesting
what are still the main problems of constructive
Arthurian criticism. It will not do, he says in
effect, to dismiss summarily all Arthurian traditions
as so many old wives’ tales. They are too
widespread and persistent not to have some basis
of solid fact underlying them: besides, the people
who believe them, love them, and write of them,
cannot all be credulous fools. Caxton, in particular,
cites the case of the “noble gentlemen”
who “required him to imprint the history of the
noble king and conqueror, king Arthur,”—one of
whom “in special said, that in him that should
say or think that there was never such a king
called Arthur might well be aretted great folly
and blindness.” This gentleman—of whom one
would gladly know more—was evidently both an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
antiquary and a student of letters, and could give
weighty reasons for the faith that was in him. First
of all, Arthur’s grave, so far from being unknown,
might be seen “in the monastery of Glastingbury.”
Again, reputable authors like Higden, Boccaccio,
and “Galfridus in his British book,” tell of his
death and recount his life; “and in divers places of
England many remembrances be yet of him, and shall
remain perpetually, and also of his knights.” His
seal, for example, “in red wax closed in beryl,”
could be seen in the Abbey of Westminster; Gawaine’s
skull and Cradock’s mantle were enshrined in Dover
Castle; the Round Table was at Winchester, and
“in other places Launcelot’s sword and many other
things.” Caxton appears to speak in his own person
when he goes on to re-inforce all this by mentioning
the records of Arthur that remained in Wales, and
“in Camelot, the great stones and the marvellous
works of iron lying under the ground, and royal
vaults, which divers now living have seen.” Moreover,
Arthur’s renown was well established in all
places, Christian and heathen, so much so that
he was “more spoken of beyond the sea,” and “more
books made of his noble acts,” than in England.
“Then all these things alleged,” he concludes, “I
could not well deny but that there was such a noble
king named Arthur, and reputed one of the nine
worthy, and first and chief of the Christian men.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
Hence he decided in all good faith, “under the
favour and correction of all noble lords and gentlemen,
to enprise to imprint” the Book of King
Arthur and of his Noble Knights of the Round
Table. And, in view of Ascham’s famous denunciation
of the book as containing but “open manslaughter
and bold bawdrie,” and of Tennyson’s
sensitiveness to the touch of</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent3">“the adulterous finger of a time</div>
<div class="verse">That hover’d between war and wantonness,”</div>
</div></div>

<p>it is well to remember that Caxton held that all that
was in it was “written for our doctrine.” “For
herein may be seen noble chivalry, courtesy,
humanity, friendliness, hardiness, love, friendship,
cowardice, murder, hate, virtue and sin. Do after
the good and leave the evil, and it shall bring you to
good fame and renommee.”</p>

<p>Caxton’s preface to the <i>Morte Darthur</i> has here
been taken as a sort of preliminary text, not only
because that famous work is, by general consent, the
fullest and the most fascinating presentment in
English of the great congeries of tales that make up
the so-called Arthurian “cycle,” but also because
Caxton’s own words, as already hinted, serve to raise,
in a peculiarly suggestive way, most of the questions
with which the critical student of the Arthurian
legends and their origin has to deal to-day.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
The <i>Morte Darthur</i> itself, it has become a commonplace
to say, remains unchallenged, in spite of its
inconsequences and inconsistencies, the supreme
Arthurian “prose epic” in English. The work is
not, of course, “epic” in any strict sense, but it
was issued by Caxton to the readers of his day as
pre-eminently an English <i>Arthuriad</i>. Arthur alone
of “the Nine Worthies” had not had justice done to
him in his own country. The two other Christian
“worthies,” Charlemagne and Godfrey of Boulogne,
had been adequately celebrated abroad, and Caxton
himself had contributed to spread the latter’s fame in
England. Why should the great English “Christian
king” remain unhonoured in his own land? It was,
therefore, with the patriotic object of blazoning the
fame of the greatest of <i>English</i> heroes that Caxton
undertook the publication of Malory’s book. Now,
the historical Arthur, so far as we know him, is not
English at all, but a “British” hero, who fought
against the Saxons, and whose prowess is one of the
jealously treasured memories of the Celtic peoples,
and particularly of the Welsh. By what process of
transformation had this British warrior become, by
Caxton’s time, the ideal “Christian king” of
England? And why, again, should he be singled out
as pre-eminently one of the three <i>Christian</i> kings of
the world, and his name linked with “the noble
history of the Saint Greal”? Here we come at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
once upon one of the disturbing influences in what
ought to be a straightforward record of the doings
of a fighting chieftain of early Britain. The quest of
the Holy Grail had, originally, nothing to do with
Arthur.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> But, by Caxton’s time, the mystic, or
religious, element in Arthurian romance had become
so prominent as to make it impossible to think of
Arthur except in association with the “high history”
of the Grail. A further complication meets us
when we are told that Malory took his material for
his narrative of the deeds of the paramount English,
or British, hero “out of certain books of French.”
Why should Malory so constantly refer to “the
French book” as his authority, and have so little
to go upon that had been written in English, or in
Welsh? Why is it that to-day, after four centuries
of diligent search in both private and public libraries,
the amount of extant British literature of an indubitably
ancient date dealing with Arthur’s exploits is
so scanty? For Caxton’s statement still remains
substantially true that, down to the fifteenth
century, “the books that had been made about
Arthur over sea,” and in foreign tongues, far outnumbered
those that had been made in Britain.
How are we to account for the popularity which the
Arthurian stories thus enjoyed on the European
continent, and for the way in which they became,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
during the Middle Ages, practically international
literary property?</p>

<p>These are the main questions which have to be
answered to-day by those who attempt to trace the
origin and growth of the Arthurian legends, and
they are all suggested in Caxton’s preface. This
little book does not pretend to furnish a final answer
to any one of them. It simply essays to present
in a summary and, it is hoped, a clear form the substance
of what is told about King Arthur in history
and legend, together with a brief notice of the
development of Arthurian literature mainly in
England. No attempt will be made to trace the
many ramifications of the subsidiary stories which
have been grafted upon the original Arthurian stock.
Characters like Perceval, or Lancelot, or Tristram,
who figure so largely in the full-orbed Arthurian
cycle, could each easily be made the subject of a
separate volume far exceeding the dimensions of the
present one. Here, attention will be concentrated,
as far as possible, upon the figure and the fortunes
of Arthur himself.</p>

<small>THE EARLIEST ARTHURIAN RECORDS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span>, in Caxton’s words, “such a king called Arthur”
ever lived in these islands, he must have flourished
during the period between the first coming of the
Saxons and the middle of the sixth century. So
much, at any rate, is clearly attested by the meagre
historical records which profess to recount his deeds.
Nothing, however, can be found in these records to
warrant the belief that he ever became “king”
of any part of Britain. His achievements as a
warrior alone are mentioned, and all that we can
gather besides from Welsh tradition only serves
to emphasise the fact that his renown among the
British people rested mainly upon his warlike
prowess. His admission to the so-called “Celtic
pantheon,” and his gradual evolution in Celtic
tradition as a great mythological figure, are matters
of purely speculative interest, and cannot be
taken into account in an attempt to answer our
first question—Who, and what, was the historical
Arthur? In Welsh we read of an “emperor”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
Arthur,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> but this title, as we shall see, implies nothing
more than that he was a war-leader, or a commander-in-chief
of a group of more or less celebrated generals.
His kingship, and his state as the head of a great
court, are entirely the creations of later romance.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Little, if anything, of historical significance is to
be deduced from the form of Arthur’s name. It
appears in the Latin chronicles as <i>Arturus</i>, and is
probably of Roman origin, derived from the form
<i>Artorius</i>.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> This is much more likely than that, as
Rhys suggests, it was “a Celtic name belonging in the
first instance to a god Arthur.” For the latter explanation,
as readers of Rhys’s <i>Arthurian Legend</i>
will know, carries us into the world of mythology,
and is made the foundation of an ingenious hypothesis
to account for Arthur’s Celtic fame. That
hypothesis, so far as it bears upon the name, is thus
summarised by its author. “The Latin <i>Artôrius</i>
and the god’s name, which we have treated as early
Brythonic <i>Artor</i>, genitive <i>Artôros</i>, would equally
yield in Welsh the familiar form <i>Arthur</i>. In either<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
case, the name would have to be regarded as an
important factor in the identification or confusion
of the man with the divinity. The latter, called
Arthur by the Brythons, was called Airem by the
Goidels, and he was probably the Artæan Mercury of
the Allobroges of ancient Gaul. His rôle was that
of Culture Hero, and his name allows one to suppose
that he was once associated, in some special
manner, with agriculture over the entire Celtic world
of antiquity. On the one hand we have the man
Arthur, whose position we have tried to define, and
on the other a greater Arthur, a more colossal figure,
of which we have, so to speak, but a <i>torso</i> rescued
from the wreck of the Celtic pantheon.”<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The
mythological Arthur, as he appears in Welsh literature
and tradition, will claim our attention in
another chapter; here, our inquiry will be confined
mainly to the Latin records in which we find,
or should expect to find, the earliest authentic
information about “the man Arthur.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>The oldest historical document in which Arthur
is mentioned by name is the famous <i>Historia
Brittonum</i> ascribed to Nennius. Parts of this work
may have been put together as early as the seventh
century,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> but the compilation, as we now have it,
was due to a Welshman named Nennius, or (in Welsh)
Nynniaw, who lived about the year 800.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The
work may be roughly divided into two parts,—the
first, of sixty-six sections or chapters, professing to
give a cursory sketch of the history of Britain from
the earliest times down to the eighth century; the
second containing a list of the twenty-eight “cities
of Britain,” together with an account of certain
“marvels” (<i>mirabilia</i>), or wonderful natural phenomena,
of Britain, which, the compiler tells us,
he “wrote as other scribes had done before him.”
The quasi-historical part of the work contains much
the fullest notice of Arthur’s military exploits to be
found in any chronicle before that of Geoffrey of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
Monmouth, while from sundry allusions to Arthur
in the section on the ‘marvels of Britain,’ we
gather that legend was already busy with his name.
The celebrated passage in which Arthur is mentioned
in the <i>Historia</i> proper<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> runs as follows:—</p>

<p>“At that time, the Saxons increased and grew
strong in Britain. After the death of Hengist,
Octha his son came from the northern part of the
kingdom to the men of Cantia, and from him are
descended its kings. Then Arthur fought against
them in those days, together with the kings of the
Britons, but he himself was leader in the battles.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
The first battle was at the mouth of the river Glein;
the second, third, fourth and fifth on the river
Dubglas, in the region Linnuis; the sixth on the
river Bassas; the seventh in the wood of Celidon,
that is, Cat Coet Celidon<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>; the eighth at the castle
of Guinnion, when Arthur bore the image of the holy
Virgin Mary on his shoulders, and when the pagans
were put to flight and a great slaughter made of
them through the might of our Lord Jesus Christ
and of Holy Mary his mother. The ninth battle
was fought at the city of Legion, the tenth on the
shore of the river, which is called Tribruit, and the
eleventh on the mountain which is called Agned.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
The twelfth battle was on Mount Badon, where
there fell nine hundred and sixty men before Arthur’s
single onset; nor had any one but himself alone a
share in their downfall, and in all the battles he
was the victor. But the enemy, while they were
overthrown in all their battles, sought help from
Germany, and continually increased in number,
and they brought kings from Germany to rule over
those who were in Britain up to the time of the
reign of Ida, who was the first king in Beornicia.”</p>

<p>One notes, in the very first words in which mention
is here made of Arthur, that he is not called a
“king,” but that he fought “together with the
kings” of the Britons, not, seemingly, as their
auxiliary, but as their commander-in-chief—<i>sed
ipse dux erat bellorum</i>. It has been suggested,<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
with much plausibility, that the term <i>dux bellorum</i>
in this passage implies that Arthur held, after the
departure of the Romans, a military office similar
to one of those established in the island during the
later years of the Roman administration. Since the
time of Severus Britain had been divided, for
defensive purposes, into two districts. At first,
most pressure came from the Picts and the Scots in
the North, and the defence of Upper Britain was
entrusted to a commander called <i>dux Britanniarum</i>.
Later, when the Saxons began to threaten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
the eastern and southern shores, a second officer—<i>comes
littoris Saxonici</i>—was appointed to command
the armies of Lower Britain. Finally, a third
officer, the <i>comes Britanniæ</i>, was given a general
supervision over the other two, and the supreme
charge of the defences of the entire country. Sir
John Rhys discovers in Arthur the representative
in the sixth century of this third officer of the
Roman military organisation. This supposition undoubtedly
helps to explain better than any other
both Nennius’s description of Arthur as <i>dux bellorum</i>,
and the seemingly wide range of country
covered by the twelve battles which he is said to
have fought.</p>

<p>It is, however, to be noted, as Rhys points out,<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
that while the title apparently given in early Welsh
literature to those who succeeded to supreme power
in Britain was <i>gwledig</i>, that name is never given to
Arthur. The term <i>gwledig</i>, itself, means no more
than “ruler” or “prince,” and is indiscriminately
used in that sense in mediæval Welsh,<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> but there is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
good reason to believe that, as applied to certain
warriors of the sixth century, the title was a
Brythonic equivalent of the official military title,
<i>comes</i> or <i>dux</i>. The most famous bearer of the title,
Maxen Wledig, comes within the Roman period,
and his renown is mainly due to romance<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>; three
others who are so called, Cunedda, Ceredig and
Emrys (the Ambrosius Aurelianus of Gildas), may
very well have held one of the military offices in
question. “Cunedda Wledig and Ceredig Wledig
are connected with the north and appear to be
guardians of the wall, while Emrys Wledig is the
antagonist of the Saxons. Thus Cunedda and
Ceredig may be regarded as Dukes of the Britains,
while Emrys is a British Count of the Saxon shore.”<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
Arthur, on the other hand, is in Welsh literature
<i>yr amherawdyr Arthur</i>, “the emperor Arthur,”<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and
so, as Rhys suggests, “it is not impossible that,
when the Roman <i>imperator</i> ceased to have anything
more to say to this country, the title was given to the
highest officer in the island, namely, the <i>Comes</i>
<i>Britanniæ</i>, and that in the words <i>yr amherawdyr
Arthur</i> we have a remnant of our insular
history.”<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>An even more difficult problem than the determination
of Arthur’s rank is the identification of the
twelve battlefields mentioned in Nennius’s record.
The twelfth century chronicler, Henry of Huntingdon,
tells us that, even in his own time, “all the
places were unknown”; hence it is not surprising
that those who have in our day sought to trace
geographically the course of Arthur’s campaigns
have not brought us much nearer certainty. The
most plausible theory is that which would locate
most, if not all, the places named by Nennius in the
region of the Roman walls in the North,<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> a theory
largely supported by Geoffrey of Monmouth’s
elaboration of Nennius’s account, and by the fact
that the names of several prominent characters
connected with the early exploits of Arthur are
localised in Lowland Scotland. On the other hand,
it is contended that Mount Badon,<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> and Urbs
Legionis, at least, must be in the South, and that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
Linnuis—which in Geoffrey appears as Lindisia
(or Lindsey), “otherwise called Lindocolinum”—is
in the East. The localisation of Arthur’s battlefields
is of no great consequence as compared with
the fact that the earliest record of them, however
vague and fragmentary, clearly points to a
long and victorious campaign conducted under his
generalship against the Saxons and other enemies
of the Britons in the sixth century. Two, at least,
of the victories recorded by Nennius appear to
have strongly seized the imagination of later writers
of Arthurian story. It mattered less to them where
“the castle of Guinnion” actually was than that
in the battle fought there Arthur “bore the image
of the holy Virgin Mary on his shoulders,” and thus
established the tradition which ultimately exalted
him into “the first and chief of the three best
Christian kings.” Nennius’s brief statement is, of
course, expanded and embroidered by Geoffrey<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
and other romantic chroniclers in turn, until the
tradition becomes so firmly rooted as to make a
modern poet like Wordsworth single out Arthur
as a champion of the early British Church, and
sing,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Amazement runs before the towering casque</div>
<div class="verse">Of Arthur, bearing through the stormy field</div>
<div class="verse">The Virgin sculptured on his Christian shield.”<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></div>
</div></div>

<p>Hence, even Tennyson takes no very great liberty
with Arthurian tradition when he converts “Arthur’s
knighthood” into a Christian fellowship avowing
that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“The King will follow Christ, and we the King,</div>
<div class="verse">In whom high God hath breathed a secret thing.”<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></div>
</div></div>

<p>The other battle, of those mentioned by Nennius,
that looms large in subsequent Arthurian story is that
of <i>Mons Badonis</i>, or Badon Hill. This battle is of
exceptional interest because it is possible to assign to
it an approximately certain date. The record in the
<i>Annales Cambriæ</i> of the year 516 as its precise date
is of less importance than the fact that Gildas, the
celebrated sixth century scribe, expressly refers to the
battle as having been fought in his natal year. In
his <i>De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniæ</i>, amid much
vehement denunciation of the British people and
their degenerate leaders, Gildas gives a short sketch
of the history of Britain down to his own time.
Coming to the Saxon invasions, he states that they
were first successfully checked under the leadership
of Ambrosius Aurelianus, the last of the Romans,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
“a modest man, who alone of all his race chanced to
survive the shocks” of that troubled time.</p>

<p>After this, he continues, the struggle went on with
varying fortune “until the year of the siege of Badon
Hill, and of almost the last great slaughter inflicted
upon the rascally crew. And this commences (a
fact I know) as the forty-fourth year, with one month
now elapsed; it is also the year of my birth.”<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
So far as the date goes, this seems to mean that the
year of the battle of Badon and of Gildas’s own
birth was the forty-fourth from that in which he
wrote. As the <i>De Excidio</i> must have been written
before the death of Maelgwn Gwynedd—the Maglocunus
against whom Gildas directs some of his
choicest invective—in or about the year 547, the
date of the fight at Badon Hill cannot well have
been later than 504. At any rate, Gildas’s testimony
is sufficient warrant that some time during the first
decade of the sixth century a battle was fought
against the Saxons at a place called Badon Hill,
in which the Britons were the victors.</p>

<p>But that battle, according to Nennius, was the
one of all the twelve recorded by him in which
Arthur gave the most signal evidence of his individual
prowess; before his single onset “nine
hundred and sixty men” fell. Now Gildas, an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
unimpeachable sixth century authority, makes
no reference whatever to Arthur’s achievements in
this, or any other, encounter with the Saxons. This
silence, so far as it affects the historicity of Arthur,
is less disturbing than it appears to be, when
account is taken of the character and motive of
Gildas’s work as a whole. The <i>De Excidio</i> is not
so much a history as a homily. Gildas belonged to
a “Romanist” party, and what the more or less
unorganised Britons sought to do for themselves,
and their independence, was to him but a decline
upon savagery and selfish native pride. It did not
suit his purpose to celebrate the name and virtues
of any British prince, and it is significant that, apart
from Ambrosius,—by birth, apparently, no less than
by his training and sympathies, a thorough-going
“Roman,”—he does not mention by name a single
British chieftain except as a target for his invective.</p>

<p>In the <i>mirabilia</i> attached to Nennius’s <i>History</i>
Arthur is a mythical figure as remote and as
elusive as he is in early Welsh poetry and triadic
lore. In them, as in the earliest Welsh poems, he
is pre-eminently Arthur “the warrior,” but he is
known besides as the owner of a famous hound, and
as the father of a son whose name had been given
to one of the natural features of the country. The
first “marvel,” in connection with which Arthur’s
name occurs, is in the region of Buelt, or Builth.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
Here, we are told, is a mound of stones, on the top of
which is one stone bearing the mark of a dog’s foot.
This mark was made by Cabal, “the dog of Arthur
the warrior” (<i>Arthuri militis</i>), when he was hunting
“the boar Troit” (<i>porcum Troit</i>). The pile of stones
was put together by Arthur, and is called Carn,
or the Cairn of, Cabal. The marvel lay in the
fact that, though men might come and carry away
the top stone “for the space of a day and a night,”
the stone was invariably found in its proper place
the next day. Another marvel, described in
immediate succession, belongs to “the region which
is called Ercing,” or Archenfield. There may be
found a tomb close by a spring which is called the
Source of the Amir,—<i>juxta fontem qui cognominatur
Licat Amir</i>, after the name of the man who was
buried there. This Amir was the son of “Arthur
the warrior,” who himself killed, and buried him,
on that spot. The “marvellous” property of this
tomb was that, when men came to measure it, at
various times, they never found it of the same size;
“and,” the writer ingenuously adds, “I have made
proof of this by myself” (<i>et ego solus probavi</i>).
These two <i>miracula</i>, as he calls them, are all that
Nennius, or his authority, has to tell us of the
mythical, as distinguished from the historical,
Arthur.</p>

<p>These apparently casual records of Arthurian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
marvels are noteworthy, not only as indicating
an early association of Arthurian traditions with
the topography of Wales, but also as affording a
connecting link between the earliest Latin documents
in which Arthur’s name is found and one of the very
oldest of the Welsh Arthurian tales. In the Welsh
romance, or rather fairy-tale, of <i>Kulhwch and Olwen</i>,—the
primitive literary form of which probably
dates from the tenth century,<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>—the hunting of the
<i>Twrch Trwyth</i>, or the Boar Trwyth (the <i>porcus Troit</i>
of Nennius), forms one of the capital features.
Now, in that hunt, as described in <i>Kulhwch and
Olwen</i>, Arthur’s dog Cabal, or Cavall,—which is the
Welsh form of the name,—takes part; he is led to
the chase by Arthur’s faithful henchman, Bedwyr,
or Bedivere.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Nor was it in bringing to bay “the
boar Troit” alone that Cavall took part. He was
conspicuous in the capture and the slaughter of
another monster, who is called an Arch- or Head-Boar,
bearing the fearsome name of “Yskithyrwyn
Benbaedd.” “And Arthur,” we read,<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> “went
himself to the chase, leading his own dog Cavall.
And Kaw, of North Britain, mounted Arthur’s
mare Llamrei, and was first in the attack. Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
Kaw, of North Britain, wielded a mighty axe, and
absolutely daring he came valiantly up to the boar,
and clave his head in twain. And Kaw took away
the tusk. Now the boar was not slain by the dogs
that Yspaddaden had mentioned, but by Cavall,
Arthur’s own dog.”<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>The battle of Mount Badon, as we have seen, is
recorded in the <i>Annales Cambriæ</i>, contained in a MS
of the tenth century. Still more interesting is another
record in that document under the year 537. In that
year, we read, was fought “the battle of Camlan,
in which Arthur and Medraut fell.” Although we
hear nothing of Medraut’s treachery, or of his being
Arthur’s nephew, here, so far as we know, is the first
recorded allusion to what subsequently became one
of the prime tragic features in Arthurian story.
Medrod, or Modred, is the villain of the romances,
and Camlan is that “dim, weird battle of the west,”
where Arthur fought the “traitor of his house,” and</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Striking the last stroke with Excalibur</div>
<div class="verse">Slew him, and all but slain himself, he fell.”<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></div>
</div></div>

<p>In Welsh prose romance we hear of Camlan both in
<i>Kulhwch and Olwen</i> and in <i>The Dream of Rhonabwy</i>;
it is also mentioned in the Triads, and there are two
references to the place in the oldest Welsh poetry.
In ‘The Verses of the Graves’ in <i>The Black Book<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
of Carmarthen</i>, we are told that “the grave of the son
of Osvran is in Camlan,”<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> and in a poem in <i>The Red
Book of Hergest</i>, a nameless bard labouring under
forebodings of coming tumult in his own day, prophesies
that “Camlan will be heard again, scenes of
groaning will again be seen, and dismal lamentations.”<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
Apart from these meagre references, Latin
chronicles and early Welsh literature are alike
altogether silent about what, in later romance and
poetry, stands out as the most fateful battle in
Arthur’s career. Geoffrey of Monmouth is the first
to give us elaborate details about Arthur’s encounter
with Modred, and his motley army of Saxons, Picts
and Scots, on the banks of “the river Cambula,”
or Camel. The river, according to Geoffrey, is in
the west country, and the battle is popularly supposed
to have been fought near Camelford,<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> in
Cornwall.</p>

<p>When we come to examine the remaining chronicle
literature of the pre-Norman period, we find no
mention of Arthur’s name, and nothing but the
briefest allusion to the campaigns in which he is
supposed to have fought. Geoffrey of Monmouth,
in the dedicatory epistle prefacing his British<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
<i>History</i>, expresses his surprise that Bede, in his
“elegant treatise,” has nothing to say about Arthur.
If Arthur was indeed widely known as a Christian
champion, it is somewhat strange that an ecclesiastical
writer of the first half of the eighth century
should have passed over his deeds in silence. Moreover,
Bede does mention Ambrosius as a successful
leader against the Saxons, and knows of “the siege
of Baddesdown-hill.” Bede’s silence about Arthur
is not to be lightly ignored, nor easily explained
away, in any critical discussion of the historicity of
Arthur. Bede stands as the primary authority and
the model of what Stubbs calls “the most ancient,
the most fertile, the longest lived and the most
widely spread” of all the “schools of English
mediæval history,”<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>—the Northumbrian. The best
and most trustworthy of the chroniclers who followed
him—such, for example, as William of Malmesbury
and William of Newburgh (Geoffrey’s remorseless
assailant)—pay their tributes to his industry,
wisdom and integrity. His <i>Ecclesiastical History</i>
is no mere desultory, or mechanical, record; it bears
the impress of a great, and honest, personality. In
his record of the Saxon invasions, it is true, he follows
Gildas, even to the extent of largely reproducing
his very words. There is no conclusive evidence
that he knew anything of the documents from which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
Nennius compiled his <i>History</i>, although one
cannot, of course, deny the probability of his knowledge
of them. The only plausible explanation of his
silence about Arthur is that he drew his materials
solely from Saxon tradition and from Latin records,
and that he was either ignorant of, or distrusted, the
Celtic, or British, traditions concerning Arthur which
had their origin and home in the West and in the then
“farthest North.” If, on the other hand, stories of
Arthur’s deeds were widely current in Lowland
Scotland, it is surprising that a Northumbrian writer
should apparently have known nothing of them.</p>

<p>Again, there is no mention whatever of Arthur in
the Saxon <i>Chronicle</i>. The fact that the <i>Chronicle</i>
contains no record of a fight, successful or otherwise,
against the Britons for a long period after 527, or
530, seems to confirm Nennius’s account of the
decisive check to the Saxon advance given in the
battles with which he associates Arthur’s name.
On the other hand, the battle at Badon Hill must,
as we have seen, have been fought long before the
year 527. There is no question about the superior
trustworthiness of the <i>Chronicle</i> to Nennius’s
narrative as a historical authority.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Here, again,
the silence can only be explained on the assumption<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
that the compilers of the Saxon <i>Chronicle</i> did not
care much about recording British victories, and
cared less, or knew nothing at all, about the British
chieftains who won them. As against this assumption,
it should be noted that the <i>Chronicle</i> does
mention such British names as Vortigern and
Natanleod,—the latter a “British king” slain in
the year 508, just at the time when Arthur’s prowess,
according to tradition, was at its height.</p>

<p>The meagreness of the pre-Norman Arthurian
records which have been here reviewed stands in
significant contrast to the amplitude and the range
of the Arthurian matter which we find in the
romantic productions of the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries. The contrast is so startling as to suggest
at once that the coming of the Normans to Britain
had much to do with what may be called the aggrandisation
of Arthur. It was Geoffrey of Monmouth,
as we shall see, writing under the direct auspices of
a cultured Norman potentate, who did more than
any other man to spread the renown of Arthur as a
presumably historical character, and to give him for
centuries an assured place in the chronicle literature
of Britain. But Geoffrey could not have written
“to order” such a book as his <i>History</i> had he
not a large stock of popular traditions to draw upon.
All the evidence seems to point to the period extending
from the tenth to the twelfth centuries as that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
of the popular growth of an Arthurian legend, on
a large scale, among “the Celtic fringe.” By the
beginning of the twelfth century Arthurian stories
were circulating freely in Brittany, Cornwall and
Wales. It is only on this supposition that one can
account, for example, for a tumult caused at Bodmin
in the year 1113, by a certain monk from Laon who
had the temerity to deny that Arthur still lived.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
Later on in the same century, as Alanus de Insulis
records,<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> belief in Arthur’s “return” was so firmly
held in the country districts of Brittany that a
denial of it might have cost a man his life. Moreover,
two chroniclers of repute who wrote before
Geoffrey bear clear testimony to the widespread
currency of Arthurian traditions in their day, and
to the curiosity aroused in serious historians concerning
the deeds of the British king.</p>

<p>None of the Anglo-Norman chroniclers ranks
higher as a trustworthy historical authority than
William of Malmesbury,—the first great successor
of Bede, whom he calls his master and exemplar.
In the first chapter of his <i>History of the Kings of
England</i>—the first version of which was completed
in 1125—we find the following passage referring
to the Saxon invasions in the sixth century:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>“When he (Vortimer) died, the British strength
decayed, and all hope fled from them; and they would
soon have perished altogether, had not Ambrosius,
the sole survivor of the Romans, who became
monarch after Vortigern, quelled the presumptuous
barbarians by the powerful aid of the warlike Arthur.
This is the Arthur of whom the idle tales of the
Britons rave even unto this day; a man worthy to be
celebrated not in the foolish dreams of deceitful
fables, but in truthful histories. For he long sustained
the declining fortunes of his native land,
and roused the uncrushed spirit of the people to
war.”</p>

<p>Then follows a reference, based upon Nennius’s
narrative, to the battle of Mount Badon. This
passage, although somewhat confused in its account
of the relative positions of Vortigern, Ambrosius and
Arthur in the events of their time, is significant as
indicating not only Arthur’s fame as a fabled British
hero in William’s day, but the historian’s own regret
at the absence of authentic information about a
warrior so worthy of lasting commemoration.
Another noteworthy reference to Arthur in William
of Malmesbury’s history occurs in his account of the
discovery in Pembrokeshire of the grave of Gawain,
“Arthur’s noble nephew.”<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Gawain, we are told,
“was driven from his kingdom by the brother and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
nephew of Hengist,” and “he deservedly shared,
with his uncle, the praise of retarding for many years
the calamity of his falling country. The grave of
Arthur is nowhere to be seen; hence ancient songs
fable that he is still to come.” Here we have
positive evidence that, long before Geoffrey’s time,
Arthur’s “return” was sung of by British bards
whose compositions, with the solitary exception of
the stanza in ‘The Songs of the Graves,’ already
referred to, appear to have been irretrievably lost.</p>

<p>Henry of Huntingdon is not so trustworthy a
chronicler as William of Malmesbury, and his
account of Arthur is, substantially, borrowed, with
embellishments, from Nennius. Henry’s place in a
review of Arthurian records is due not to his
<i>History</i>, but to a letter, addressed to a friend
named Warinus,<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> which singularly attests the interest
then felt in the history of Arthur. That letter
recounts how Henry, while on a journey to Rome
in the year 1139, stopped at the abbey of Bec in
Normandy and was there shown by the chronicler,
Robert of Torigni, a “great book,” written by one
“Geoffrey Arthur,” containing a history of the early
kings of Britain. The book in question was, almost
certainly, an early draft of Geoffrey of Monmouth’s
famous <i>Historia Regum Britanniæ</i>. But it is curious
to find that Henry’s abstract of the book, as given<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
in the letter to Warinus, differs in one important
respect—and that alone concerns us at this stage—from
the text of Geoffrey’s <i>History</i> as given
in all the MSS of that work in its final form.
Geoffrey’s account of the “passing” of Arthur—an
incident which offered to so imaginative a
writer unrivalled opportunities of romantic decoration—is
singularly devoid of ornament. Henry’s
abstract of this part of the book which he found
at Bec is, on the other hand, a highly-coloured
piece of writing.</p>

<p>“When he (Arthur) was about to cross over the
Alps, an envoy said unto him, ‘Modred, thy nephew,
hath set thy crown upon his own head with the
assistance of Cheldric, king of the English, and hath
taken thy wife unto himself.’ Arthur, thereupon,
seething over with wondrous wrath, returning into
England, conquered Modred in battle, and after
pursuing him as far as unto Cornwall, with a few men
fell upon him in the midst of many, and when he saw
that he could not turn back said, ‘Comrades, let
us sell our death dear. I, for my part, will smite off
the head of my nephew and my betrayer, after which
death will be a delight unto me.’ Thus spake he,
and hewing a way for himself with his sword through
the press, dragged Modred by the helmet into the
midst of his own men and cut through his mailed
neck as through a straw. Natheless, as he went, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
as he did the deed, so many wounds did he receive
that he fell, albeit that his kinsmen the Britons
deny that he is dead, and do even yet solemnly
await his coming again. He was, indeed, the very
first man of his time in warlike prowess, bounty
and wit.”<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>The vivid personal details of this narrative may
be due to Henry’s own imagination, for it is well
known that he, like Geoffrey, exercised that faculty
largely in his treatment of history; but, even so,
the passage is curiously significant in its bearing
upon the martial fame of Arthur, and upon the
belief in his “return” cherished by “his kinsmen
the Britons,” in the first half of the twelfth
century.</p>

<p>The review given in this chapter of the earliest
Arthurian records,—all of which are in Latin,—as
distinguished from Celtic song or fable, points
clearly to the gradual growth, around the personality
of a real British warrior of the sixth century, of a
legend which by the twelfth century had assumed
a form that arrested, though it might baffle, the
leading historians of the day. Now, it so happened
that the twelfth century was the seed-time of
mediæval romance in Europe, and how effectively
the legend of Arthur was thenceforth exploited for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
romantic purposes will be seen later on. It remains,
however, for us, first, to give some account of what
was known, or fabled, about Arthur among “his
kinsmen the Britons” themselves, as recorded in
their extant prose and poetry.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

<small>ARTHUR IN WELSH LEGEND AND LITERATURE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> begin once more with Caxton, the preface to the
<i>Morte Darthur</i> states that of the “noble volumes
made of Arthur and his noble knights” there “be
many in Welsh.” Caxton was, here, either drawing
upon his imagination or speaking with imperfect
knowledge. It is true that Arthur figures largely
in the <i>Mabinogion</i>, but when we come to examine
closely even these tales, we find that he appears
only in five out of the eleven<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> which are designated
by that name in Lady Charlotte Guest’s well-known
translation, while in the four tales—probably the
oldest of all—to which alone the title of “mabinogion”
is strictly applicable, he does not appear at
all. Again, in the oldest Welsh poetry Arthur is the
merest shadow, and even the mediæval Welsh poets,
who might have been expected to drink deep of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
wells of romance, mention him only in the most
casual and perfunctory way. There is, however,
just enough in these old Welsh poems and prose
stories to indicate that a legend of Arthur existed
in Wales from a very early period—certainly from
a period long before the appearance of Geoffrey
of Monmouth’s <i>History</i> in the twelfth century.
The traditions embodied in this literature are indeed
vague and disconnected enough, for they are drawn
from an age when the art of romantic “exploitation”
had not yet been learnt; but they bear the unmistakable
marks of a legendary growth indigenous
to Wales itself. As such, they are of exceptional
interest, and deserve a somewhat fuller notice than
their actual range and extent would seem to warrant.</p>

<p>The earliest Welsh literature in which we read
of Arthur may be divided into three distinct and
well-marked groups. First come the few poems in
the oldest Welsh MSS which mention him. The
allusions to Arthur in these poems represent, probably,
traditions derived from an earlier period than
anything contained in the second group of writings
to be noticed, the prose tales,—although, as will be
seen, one or two of the poems and prose stories appear
to refer to the same legends. Lastly, we have the
Triads, which, according to Rhys, “give us the
oldest account of Arthur.”<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>The compositions attributed to the oldest Welsh
bards have come down to us in MSS which date
from the twelfth to the end of the fourteenth century;
the best known of them are four in number, and
these were edited long ago, with translations, by the
late Dr W. F. Skene under the title of <i>The Four
Ancient Books of Wales</i>.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> It is unnecessary here to
touch upon controversial questions affecting the
antiquity and the genuineness of the poems contained
in these MSS. Many of them are, plainly
enough, not much older than the date of the compilation
of the particular MS in which they are found.
Others, however, as plainly contain what Matthew
Arnold,<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> speaking of the prose <i>Mabinogion</i>, calls
“a <i>detritus</i> of something far older,” and it is impossible
to avoid the conclusion that some of them refer
to historical events and personages of the sixth and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
seventh centuries, while others contain mythological
matter derived from a much remoter age.
Here, the references to Arthur in these poems alone
concern us. They are strangely few in number,
and tantalisingly brief. In <i>The Black Book of
Carmarthen</i> he is mentioned five times, in <i>The
Book of Aneirin</i> only once. He is the central figure
in a remarkable poem in <i>The Book of Taliesin</i>, and
his name occurs in one other poem in that MS;
in the poetry of <i>The Red Book of Hergest</i> nothing is
heard of him, except in a poem called ‘Gereint, son
of Erbin,’ which is also found in <i>The Black Book</i>.
Three of the references in <i>The Black Book</i> are of the
briefest character. In one poem<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> the bard tells
us that he “has been where Llacheu, the son of
Arthur, was slain,” and that is all; in another,
evidently a late poem, we hear of “Arthur’s host,”
or “retinue” (<i>teulu Arthur</i>)<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>; while in a stanza,
already alluded to, in “The Songs of the Graves,”
we are told that his grave is unknown. In the
solitary passage in which his name occurs in <i>The
Book of Aneirin</i> he is a standard of comparison,—a
certain warrior is described as being “an Arthur in
the exhaustive conflict”<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>; the second of the two
poems in which he is mentioned in <i>The Book of</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
<i>Taliesin</i> refers, without comment or description,
merely to “Arthur’s steed.”<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>There remain to be noticed the three poems which,
alone, contain anything more than such casual
allusions as those we have just cited. Two of them
are in <i>The Black Book</i>, and one would seem to
bring us into touch, though but remotely, with the
historical “Arthur the warrior,”—the <i>dux bellorum</i>
of Nennius, who may have held “the place of the
<i>imperator</i> himself, when Britain ceased to be part
of the dominions of Rome.”<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> This latter poem
is called ‘Gereint <i>filius</i> Erbin,’<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>—a title identical
with that of the prose romance which is the Welsh
collateral of Chrétien de Troyes’s <i>Erec</i>,—and,
although Gereint is its hero, Arthur is introduced
as a war-leader of seemingly higher rank. “At
Llongborth,” the bard sings,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent3">“saw I of Arthur’s</div>
<div class="verse">Brave men hewing with steel,</div>
<div class="verse">(Men of the) emperor, director of toil.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">At Llongborth there fell of Gereint’s</div>
<div class="verse">Brave men from the borders of Devon,</div>
<div class="verse">And, ere they were slain, they slew.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Where “Llongborth,” or “Ship’s port,” was, we do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
not know, but the whole poem appears to refer to
an actual battle in which Gereint’s deeds had left
a profound impression upon his bardic eulogist.
The association, in this poem, of Arthur with Gereint
brings us, for the first time, into the company of one
of the knights who, in later romance, belong to
the goodly fellowship of the Round Table. In the
second <i>Black Book</i> poem we are introduced to two
others who figure prominently in the romances,—Kei,
or “Kay the seneschal,” and Bedwyr, or Bedivere,
“the latest-left of all” King Arthur’s knights.
This poem is cast in the form of a dialogue between
Arthur and the keeper of a castle who is called
Glewlwyd of the Mighty Grasp, and who appears
in the Welsh prose stories as one of Arthur’s chief
“porters.” Arthur seeks entrance to the castle, and
Glewlwyd, apparently, will not open the gates without
satisfying himself as to the number and the credentials
of his followers. Arthur, thereupon, proceeds
to name them and to recount their achievements.
They are a weird company, bearing strange names
reaching back to the remotest regions of primitive
Welsh myth. Among them are Mabon, the son of
Modron, “Uther Pendragon’s man”; Manawyddan,
the son of Llŷr, “profound in counsel,” who “brought
home a pierced buckler from Tryvrwyd”<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>; Mabon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
son of Mellt, “who stained the grass with gore”;
Llwch Llawynawc, Angwas the Winged, Arthur’s
son Llacheu, and others.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> But the two doughtiest
among the champions Arthur has around him
are Bedwyr and Kei. Bedwyr, like Manawyddan,
fought at Tryvrwyd, and “by the hundred they fell”
before him there; “nine hundred to watch, six
hundred to attack,” continues the bard, was the
measure of Bedwyr’s prowess. Still mightier was
“the worthy Kei.” “Vain were it to boast”
against him in battle; “he slew as would an
hundred,—unless it were God’s doing, Kei’s death
would be unachieved.” Kei, we are further told,
“slew nine witches”; he went “to Mona to destroy
lions,” and he fought against a mysterious monster
called “Palug’s Cat.” Capable as he was of all
this, it is not surprising to hear that Kei’s drinking
powers were equal to those of four men. Of the
deeds of Arthur himself the poem tells us nothing.</p>

<p>A still more remarkable poem,—the last that
remains to be noticed,—in which certain strange
deeds of Arthur are commemorated, is found in
<i>The Book of Taliesin</i> under the name of ‘Preiddeu
Annwvn,’ or ‘The Spoils of Hades.’ It refers to
various expeditions made by Arthur and his men,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
in his ship Pridwen to certain mysterious regions
oversea. Definite names enough are given to the
different places visited—Caer Sidi, Caer Rigor, Caer
Vandwy, and so on,—but the places themselves
remain quite unidentified. “Three freights of
Pridwen,” sings the bard, “were they who went
with Arthur” on these expeditions; “seven alone
were we who returned” therefrom. One of the
exploits achieved in the course of these voyages was,
apparently, the rape of a cauldron belonging to the
King of Hades, and the whole poem, according to
Rhys,<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> “evidently deals with expeditions conducted
by Arthur by sea to the realms of twilight and
darkness.”</p>

<p>The last two poems here referred to have several
features in common with what is, probably, the
oldest of the Arthurian prose tales in Welsh,—the
story of <i>Kulhwch and Olwen</i>. That story also tells
of the rape of a cauldron, belonging not, indeed, to
the King of Hades, but to one Diwrnach, who lived
across the sea in Ireland; Arthur went in quest of it,
with a small retinue, in his ship Pridwen, and brought
it home “full of Irish money.” The second of the
two poems refers to “a speckled ox” (<i>ych brych</i>),
and the acquisition of “a speckled ox” was one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
of the tasks imposed upon Kulhwch by Olwen’s
father as part of the price to be paid for her hand.
Again, nearly all the persons mentioned in <i>The Black
Book</i> dialogue between Arthur and Glewlwyd figure
also in <i>Kulhwch and Olwen</i>. So, where the oldest
Welsh Arthurian poetry comes into contact with the
oldest Welsh prose, the Arthur that we find dimly
outlined in both is a purely mythical hero.</p>

<p><i>Kulhwch and Olwen</i>, the most fantastic of all the
Welsh prose tales dealing with Arthur, palpably
embodies Arthurian traditions current in Wales at a
very early date. “Almost every page of this tale,”
writes Matthew Arnold,<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> “points to traditions and
personages of the most remote antiquity, and is
instinct with the very breath of the primitive world.”
The tale relates of the wooing of Olwen, the daughter
of one bearing the formidable name of Yspaddaden
Pen Kawr, by Kulhwch, so called because “he had
been found in a swine’s burrow,” but “nevertheless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
a boy of gentle lineage, and cousin unto Arthur.”
Kulhwch, after being told by his stepmother that
he “should never have a wife until he obtained
Olwen,” is informed by his father that “that will
be easy for him.” “Arthur is thy cousin,” the
father says; “go, therefore, unto Arthur, to cut thy
hair, and ask this of him as a boon.” The winning
of Olwen,—hard enough though it appears in the
story, which is mainly concerned with the long
series of laborious tasks imposed upon Kulhwch
as conditions of gaining her hand—is made “easy”
through Arthur’s intervention. The hero starts by
duly presenting himself at “the gate of Arthur’s
palace,” and he there meets with the porter,
Glewlwyd of the Mighty Grasp, who conveys to
Arthur the news of his arrival. Arthur is introduced
to us as the head of a court, keeping high state
in his palace, or hall, which is called Ehangwen
(Broad-White). When Kulhwch comes to ask his
“boon” of him, Arthur replies, “Thou shalt receive
the boon whatsoever thy tongue may name, as far
as the wind dries, and the rain moistens, and the sun
revolves, and the sea encircles, and the earth extends,—save
only my ship; and my mantle; and
Caledvwlch,<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> my sword; and Rhongomyant, my
lance; and Wynebgwrthucher, my shield; and
Carnwennan, my dagger; and Gwenhwyvar, my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
wife.” Kulhwch proceeds to ask for help in his
quest not only from Arthur himself, but also from
his knights and retainers, of whom a long and weird
list is given. Kai and Bedwyr—an apparently
inseparable pair—are first mentioned; then follows
a series of strange and fantastic names, of most of
which no other record remains in fable or folk-lore.
Characters such as Taliesin, the chief of bards;
Manawyddan, son of Llŷr; Gereint, son of Erbin;
Gwynn, the son of Nudd, and some others, are heard
of elsewhere. But what are we to make of beings
like Sugyn, the son of Sugnedydd, “who could suck
up the sea on which were three hundred ships, so
as to leave nothing but a dry strand”; or, “Gilla
of the Deer-Legs, the chief-leaper of Ireland,” who
“would clear three hundred acres at one bound”;
or, Gwevyl, the son of Gwestad, who, “on the day
that he was sad, would let one of his lips drop below
his waist, while he turned up the other like a cap
upon his head”; or, Medyr, the son of Methredydd,
who could from Cornwall “unerringly shoot the
wren through the two legs” as far away as Ireland;
and other weird people endowed with similar superhuman
attributes? Arthur himself figures in the
tale as a fairy king, having all these strange beings
at his service, and giving them orders in the most
direct and matter-of-fact way. One of his most
useful henchmen, for example, is “Menw, the son of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
Teirgwaedd”—corresponding to the conventional
enchanter of the universal fairy world—who could
“cast a charm and an illusion over them, so that
none might see them while they could see every
one.” Other characters in the motley crowd are said
to “come from the confines of Hell”; others are
“attendants” and “huntsmen” of Arthur, while
quite a large group figure as his “uncles” and
“kindred on his father’s side.”</p>

<p>Among the many trials to which Olwen’s father
submits Kulhwch is that of “getting Arthur and
his companions to hunt the Twrch Trwyth.”
“He,” says Yspaddaden, “is a mighty man, and
he will not come for thee, neither wilt thou be able
to compel him.” Kulhwch knew better, for he had
already secured Arthur’s promise to help him to
the utmost of his own and his companions’ resources.
The hunting of the Boar (the <i>porcus Troit</i>) is one of
the main features of the story; and, except perhaps
Meleager’s adventure to the quarry of the Calydonian
boar, there is no such swine-hunt in primitive
literature. Many strange men and beasts and implements
were required for the chase and despatch
of Twrch Trwyth, and for the capture of “the comb
and scissors” between his ears, which Yspaddaden
wanted for the proper trimming of his unruly hair.
Mabon, the son of Modron; Garselit, “the chief
huntsman of Ireland”; Gwynn, the son of Nudd,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
“whom God has placed over the brood of devils
in Annwn”; Gilhennin, “the king of France”;
Drudwyn, “the whelp of Greid”; Du, “the horse
of Môr of Oerveddawg”; “the sword of Gwrnach
the Giant”;—all these, and many more such
auxiliaries, had to be secured for the Boar’s
capture. But Kulhwch is not dismayed; “my
lord and kinsman Arthur,” he tells Yspaddaden,
“will obtain for me all these things, and I shall
gain thy daughter, and thou shalt lose thy life.”</p>

<p>The story of the hunt, with its many marvels, is
chiefly remarkable for its minute topographical and
personal detail,—the topography being indeed so
precise as to make it all but possible to trace on a
modern map the route taken by the hunters.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> The
Boar is finally driven into Cornwall, and thence
“straight forward into the deep sea; and thenceforth
it was never known whither he went.”
“Then,” says the story-teller, “Arthur went to
Gelli Wic, in Cornwall, to anoint himself, and to
rest from his fatigues.” He had, however, to assist
Kulhwch in one further enterprise,—the obtaining of
“the blood of the witch Orddu, of Pen Nant Govid
(the Head of the Vale of Grief), on the confines of
Hell.” He did so by slaying the hag with his own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
hand, cleaving her in twain “with Carnwennan,
his dagger.” After that Kulhwch goes boldly to
Yspaddaden and asks, “Is thy daughter mine
now?” “She is thine,” said he, “but therefore
needest thou not thank me, but Arthur, who hath
accomplished this for thee.”</p>

<p><i>Kulhwch and Olwen</i>, it will be seen from this
brief account of it, is in all essentials a fairy-tale,
embodying a mass of fantastic, and even grotesque,
folk-lore of an obviously pre-historic antiquity. It
is to fairy-land, also, that we are transported
in another of the Welsh tales, <i>The Dream of
Rhonabwy</i>, composed probably during the latter
half of the twelfth century. Both it and <i>Kulhwch</i>
have much in common with the mythic tales of Ireland.
“We possess a considerable number of Irish
sagas, which betray the same characteristics as the
two Welsh tales: fondness for enumeration, triadic
grouping, <i>bravura</i> descriptive passages, and, notably
in <i>Bricriu’s Feast</i>, a distinct semi-parodistic tone.”
The <i>Dream</i>,—of which the central feature, the story

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>Among the marvellous objects described are Arthur’s
sword and mantle (called Gwenn), but the story-teller
does not let his fancy play around them so
freely as around most of the things he depicts. The
sword was in the keeping of “Kadwr, earl of Cornwall,”
whose duty it was to “arm the king on the
days of battle.” “And the similitude of two
serpents was upon the sword in gold. And when it
was drawn from its scabbard, it seemed as if two
flames of fire burst forth from the jaws of serpents.”
Gwenn, the mantle, was “of diapered satin” with
“an apple of ruddy gold at each corner thereof,”
and “it was one of its properties that upon whomsoever
it was put, he became lost to sight though
he himself could see every one.” Arthur himself is,
in this tale, constantly referred to as “the Emperor,”
and he is first met with “sitting on a flat island”
below the Ford of the Cross on the Severn, “with
Bedwini the Bishop on one side of him, and Gwarthegydd,
the son of Kaw, on the other.” Among his
retainers are his “cousin” March (or Mark), the son
of Meirchion, prince of “the men of Norway”;
Edern, the son of Nudd, prince of “the men of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
Denmark”; Kai, “the fairest horseman in all
Arthur’s Court”; and a host of others, many of
whose names appear in the long catalogue given in
<i>Kulhwch and Olwen</i>. Some of these names, such as
Tristan, the son of Tallwch, and Peredur of the Long
Lance, bring us into touch with the later developments
of Arthurian romance.</p>

<p>The other three <i>Mabinogion</i>, so called, in which
Arthur figures,—<i>The Lady of the Fountain</i>, <i>Geraint</i>,
and <i>Peredur</i>,—will be noticed in a subsequent
chapter, for these stories, whether they were directly
based upon French originals or not, palpably belong
to a period when the Arthurian legends had been,
or were being, exploited for romantic purposes by
French writers. The natural transition from such
stories as <i>Kulhwch and Olwen</i> is to the Welsh Triads,
the oldest group of which certainly contain traditions
about Arthur as archaic as anything to be found in
either the poems or the prose tales already reviewed.
Here, only a few of the more significant allusions to
Arthur contained in them need be quoted. Arthur
is first mentioned in connection with Medraut’s,
or Modred’s, treachery, and he is described—much
as in Geoffrey’s Chronicle—as conducting a victorious
campaign against the Romans. The final
battle with the Romans, of which Geoffrey gives so
elaborate an account, is said to take place “beyond
Mount Mynneu,” and in it Arthur encounters, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
slays with his own hand, the Roman Emperor
himself.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> Modred, who had been left in charge
of Britain, hearing of the grievous slaughter of
Arthur’s “best men” in this battle, revolts. Arthur
returns, “and then took place the battle of Camlan
between Arthur and Medraut, when Arthur slew
Medraut, and Arthur himself was mortally wounded;
and <i>he was buried in a palace in the isle of Avallach</i>.”
In another Triad, Arthur is made responsible for one
of “the Three Wicked Uncoverings” of the Isle of
Britain, viz., the uncovering of “the head of Brân
the Blessed from the White Mount” in London.
The ‘mabinogi’ of <i>Branwen, daughter of Llŷr</i>,
relates how the head of Brân had been buried, by
his own command, in the White Mount, with
its face towards France. While it remained undisturbed,
this island would be secure from invasion,—hence
the “wickedness” of Arthur’s “uncovering.”
Another of the Triads speaks of Arthur as the
husband of three wives, each called Guinivere,—“Gwenhwyfar,
the daughter of Gwryd Gwent,
Gwenhwyfar, the daughter of Gwythur, son of
Greidawl, and Gwenhwyfar, the daughter of Ogrvan
the Giant.” This strange statement, as Rhys points
out, appears to have its parallel in the Irish story of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
Echaid Airem, where we hear of three women all
bearing the name of Etáin, and “the three Gwenhwyfars
are the Welsh equivalents of the three
Etáins, and the article in the Triads must be held to
be of great antiquity.”<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> One of the last records
in this group of Triads has affinities both with the
four ‘Mabinogion,’ properly so-called, and with one
of the old Welsh poems cited in this chapter; it
also contains a curiously interesting reference to a
character who, in mediæval romance, appears as the
hero of the most poetical of all the legends included
in the Arthurian cycle. This Triad refers, mainly, to
certain swine legends, and is entitled <i>The Three
Stout Swineherds of the Isle of Britain</i>; but it
mentions, besides swine, “Palug’s cat,”—hence its
connection with ‘Preiddeu Annwvn,’ the poem from
<i>The Book of Taliesin</i> already alluded to. The first
of the “three swineherds” is Pryderi, the son of
Pwyll, “Head of Annwn,” and his story is told in
full in the ‘mabinogi’ of <i>Pwyll, prince of Dyved</i>.
It is strange, however, to find that the second of
these pre-eminent swineherds is Drystan, or Tristan,
son of Tallwch,—the knightly Tristram of later
romance. “The second” stout swineherd, so the
record runs, “was Drystan, son of Tallwch, with the
swine of March (Mark), son of Meirchion, while the
swineherd went on a message to Essyllt (Iseult).<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
Arthur and March and Kai and Bedwyr came, all
four to him, but obtained from Drystan not even
as much as a single porker, whether by force, or
fraud, or theft.”</p>

<p>These four examples are quite sufficient to show
that in the Triads, no less than in the oldest Welsh
tales and poems dealing with Arthur, we come upon
traditions handed down from a very remote age,
which were all but incomprehensible to the mediæval
scribes who garnered them, and are therefore preserved
in a bewilderingly confused and disconnected
form. They are the <i>disjecta membra</i> of a lost
mythology, the legacy of pre-historic Celtic heathendom,
which even the most learned and ingenious
interpreters of primitive folk-lore and religion find
it well-nigh impossible to restore into a coherent and
intelligible whole.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>They, however, who would rob us of a historical
and a chivalric King Arthur must, perforce, leave
us an Arthur whose attributes as a presumed pagan
deity do not prevent the unsophisticated from
recognising in him an ideal prince of fairy-land.
It is as such a prince that he appears against the
setting of “old,” but not altogether “unhappy,
far-off things, and battles long ago,” in which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
is presented in the early literature of Wales. It
is as such a prince that one, at least, of the great
English poets accepts him. To Spenser, Arthur,
“taken from mother’s pap” and</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent8">“straight deliver’d to a Faery knight</div>
<div class="verse">To be upbrought in gentle thewes and martiall might,”<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></div>
</div></div>

<p>was just the potent deliverer required to bring
the Red Cross Knight and the rest of that
questing company out of their various difficulties,
and to establish, through a series of timely interventions,
his right to the hand of the Fairy
Queen.</p>

<p>In both <i>Kulhwch and Olwen</i> and <i>The Dream of
Rhonabwy</i>, as also in the Triads, we find frequent
mention of Cornwall as a district with which Arthur
is intimately connected. It is to Cornwall that he
retires to rest after the hunting of the boar; and it
is to Cornwall that Kai, at the close of <i>The Dream
of Rhonabwy</i>, bids all repair who “would follow
Arthur.” His home, and his court, there is at a
place called Kelli, or Gelli, Wic. In later Arthurian
literature little, if anything, is heard of Kelli Wic;
Caerleon-upon-Usk displaces it altogether as the
scene of Arthur’s central court. But, with Geoffrey
of Monmouth, two other Cornish localities are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
brought into dramatic connection with Arthur’s
fortunes—viz., Tintagol, or Tintagel; and Dimilioc,
or Damelioc. These places are unheard of in the
Welsh Arthurian tales, but, according to Geoffrey,
it was at Dimilioc that Uther besieged, and his men
slew, Gorlois; and it was this siege that enabled
Uther, in the semblance of Gorlois, to gain access to
Igerne in her retreat at the castle of Tintagel, and
so to become the father of “the most renowned
Arthur.” It is a pity that no Cornish records have
survived to throw some further light upon these
momentous events. It is, however, very unlikely
that Geoffrey would have incorporated them in his
narrative, had there not been, in Cornwall as in
Wales, traditions long current which associated the
name of Arthur with some of the ancient strongholds
of the country. No less significant, as indicative
of the existence of a separate Cornish legend of
Arthur, is that Geoffrey, with others, tells us that
the last and fatal battle with Medrod took place
on the river Camel in Cornwall. It is not, perhaps,
easy to reconcile these traditions with the theory
that Arthur’s life and achievements were confined
to North Britain. But that theory is no less difficult
to reconcile with the abundance, and the ubiquity,
of Arthurian place-names in all the districts, except
Ireland, that make up “the Celtic fringe.” “Only
the Devil is more often mentioned in local association<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
than Arthur.”<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> The precise significance of
such association is perhaps, in both cases, equally
indeterminable.</p>

<p>Investigators of Arthurian origins talk a good
deal about Brittany. Unfortunately, there is no
early Breton, any more than Cornish, literature
to draw upon for any further information about
a pre-historic, or a pre-romantic, Arthur. The
<i>lais</i> of Marie of France are supposed to embody
matter borrowed from Breton minstrels who sang
before the flourishing of romance; but only one of
her poems, ‘Lanval’—and that but remotely—has
any connection with early Arthurian lore. It may
be that “the Bretons” whom Wace mentions as
“telling many a fable of the Table Round”<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> were
Armorican Britons. We know for certain, at any
rate, that a legend of Arthur, which included a belief
in his “return,” had taken firm root in Brittany
by the twelfth century.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> There is, therefore, no
difficulty about assuming that it was from the
Bretons, rather than from the Welsh, that the
Normans derived their first knowledge of Arthur,
and so came to construct out of the stories connected
with him the romantic cycle known as the <i>matière
de Bretagne</i>. The controversy waged about the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
relative shares of Great and of Little Britain in
supplying matter for the French romantic writers<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
is of no real consequence—everybody is agreed that
that matter is to be ultimately traced to a Celtic, and
a British, source. What is of more importance is the
fact that before any “matter of Britain” is heard
of as a great romantic theme, a writer appeared who,
by means of an orderly narrative embodied in an
apparently sober chronicle, aroused an interest in
Arthur’s life and deeds such as no mere romance
could ever have succeeded in doing. He was
Geoffrey of Monmouth, and it is in his <i>History</i>
that we get our first full-length portrait of Arthur
as a great, and actual, “king of Britain.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Chaucer</span>, in his <i>Hous of Fame</i>, gives a station of
conspicuous honour to a group of writers whose
claim to distinction is that they are all “besy for to

</div></div>

<p>With him, however, are ranged persons of somewhat
doubtful reputation; to wit, Dares, the Phrygian,
and “Tytus,” or Dictys, the Cretan, “Guido de
Columpnis,” and—significantly—“English Gaufride.”
“Gaufride,” or Geoffrey, owes his modern
renown much more to his contributions to Arthurian
literature than to his modest additions to the
tale of Troy. His detractors will have it that the
Arthurian portions of his so-called <i>History</i> are as
fabulous as his account of the descent of the British
race from Brutus, the son of Æneas. He had, however,
the authority of Nennius, at least, for his use<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
of the Brutus legend. He had the brief records of
Nennius, also, to work upon as a foundation for the
elaborate narrative which he gives of the life and
deeds of King Arthur. But that narrative came
upon the world as quite a new, and a startling thing.
It is, perhaps, no exaggeration to term its appearance
the chief literary event of the twelfth century;
at any rate, it is certain that it aroused
infinitely greater interest than the story of what
Brutus and his immediate descendants achieved in
Britain. Chaucer, however,—to judge, at least, by
his <i>Tale of Sir Thopas</i>,—regarded the newer romantic
matters with good-humoured contempt; and the
tale of Troy, in its various ramifications, challenged
his imagination much more insistently than such a
new-fangled theme as the story of Arthur.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the fact that Geoffrey’s use of
the Brutus legend is what constitutes the claim of
his <i>History</i> to rank as the first, and the greatest,
of a long series of “Bruts,”—English, French and
Welsh,—his real title to literary fame rests upon his
achievement, and his influence, as a contributor to
Arthurian story. The Arthurian legend would, undoubtedly,
have attracted the attention of European
poets and romancers, had Geoffrey’s <i>History</i> never
been written. It was current, as we have seen, in
Wales, Brittany and Cornwall long before his time.
There is even evidence that Arthur, and tales concerning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
him, were known in the south of Europe
before he took up his pen. But it is quite certain
that Arthur would never have figured as he does
in chronicle literature, and so have come to be
regarded as an authentic historical character, were
it not for Geoffrey’s narrative. And it may be
doubted whether English poets, at any rate,—to
judge from the homage which they pay Geoffrey,—would
have dallied so much over Arthurian fable had
they not at their call what Wordsworth describes as
that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent3">“British record long concealed</div>
<div class="verse">In old Armorica, whose secret springs</div>
<div class="verse">No Gothic conqueror ever drank.”<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></div>
</div></div>

<p>Now, it so happens that the “British record,”
which Wordsworth, with a poet’s licence, so confidently
tells us was “long concealed in old Armorica,”
has never yet been discovered, and the mystery
surrounding it is the chief critical problem which
still baffles every student of the work of Geoffrey
of Monmouth. This problem is deliberately set
us by Geoffrey himself at the very beginning
of his Chronicle, for he states that he is simply
translating into the Latin tongue “a certain most
ancient book in the British language,” which,—as
he adds in his epilogue,—“Walter, archdeacon of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
Oxford, brought hither from Brittany.” That he
had some “book,” or books, other than Nennius,
to supply him with material, is not only highly
probable, but almost certain; and, if we are to
believe his own statement, that book must have
been in “the British language.” But the fact
remains that no document, either in Welsh or in
Breton, has yet been found even remotely resembling
that which Walter, the archdeacon, is said to have
brought over from Brittany. It is possible, however,
that those who have been searching for it
have attached too much importance to the “British”
book, and that, even were it to be discovered, its
contents would only serve to show how deftly
Geoffrey manipulated his material, and how artfully
he succeeded in making his story of Arthur
just what his Norman patrons, and the new romantic
taste of the time, required. No intelligent reader
of Geoffrey’s <i>History</i> can, at any rate, escape the
conclusion that the work, especially in its treatment
of both the Brutus legend and the career of Arthur,
was written with a motive. Besides, it is a work
<i>sui generis</i> among the chronicle literature of its time,
and bears clear evidence of deliberate romantic embellishment.
In order to apprehend what Geoffrey’s
motive may have been, and how far he is to be
regarded as a conscious romancer, it is necessary,
first of all, to know something of the writer himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
and of the age and the people for whom he wrote;
a brief examination of the actual contents of the
<i>History</i>, and more particularly of its Arthurian
portions, may perhaps serve, subsequently, to clear
up as much of the rest of the matter as is possible, in
the absence of any knowledge of “the British book.”</p>

<p>The amount of authentic biographical detail
ascertainable concerning Geoffrey is exceedingly
scanty, and it is, therefore, not surprising that what
is told about him in many reputable literary histories
is distressingly inaccurate. Even the name of his
famous book is, often, wrongly given; it is constantly
cited as <i>Historia Brittonum</i>—the title of
Nennius’ compilation—instead of as <i>Historia Regum
Britanniæ</i>. Walter, the archdeacon of Oxford,
again, has been confused with Walter Map, who
could hardly have been more than about twelve
years old when Geoffrey died. Geoffrey himself is
loosely designated “archdeacon of Monmouth,”
whereas there was no archdeaconry of Monmouth
in his time. He is said to have become, ultimately,
bishop of Llandaff, and to have died in the year 1152,—the
actual facts, however, being that he was
ordained priest and, almost simultaneously, appointed
bishop of St Asaph in 1152, and that he died
at Llandaff in 1155. The exact dates of the beginning,
and of the completion, of his <i>History</i> cannot
be definitely fixed; but we know enough about the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
work to say that it must have existed, in some form,
as early as 1139, at the latest, and that it was
complete in the form in which we now have it by
the year 1148.</p>

<p>There is no conclusive evidence that Geoffrey
was of Welsh birth, or that his home, other than a
monastic domicile, was at Monmouth. The dedication
of his <i>History</i>, however, proves that he
claimed the patronage of a Norman prince who was
lord of a tract of Welsh country, the north-west
boundary of which all but extended to the town of
Monmouth. Early in the twelfth century Robert,
earl of Gloucester, acquired the lordship of Glamorgan
by marriage with Mabel, the daughter and
heiress of Robert Fitz-Hamon. Eminent as both
statesman and warrior, Robert of Gloucester, like
his father, Henry Beauclerc, was a student of letters
and a generous friend of literary men. It is no empty
compliment that Geoffrey pays Robert when he
hails him as “one nurtured in the liberal arts by
philosophy, and called unto the command of our
armies by his own inborn prowess of knighthood,”
and “whom in these our days Britain haileth
with heart-felt affection as though she had been
vouchsafed another Henry.”<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> Robert’s enlightened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
patronage of men of letters is sufficiently attested by
the fact that William of Malmesbury, the most
distinguished historian of his day, dedicated to him
his <i>History of the Kings of England</i>. The abbey of
Margam, whose chronicle is an important authority
for the history of mediæval Wales, was founded by
him; another abbey in which a valuable chronicle
was compiled—that of Tewkesbury—had in him
one of its chief benefactors. On his estates at
Torigni in Normandy was born Robert of the Mount,
afterwards abbot of Mont St Michel, eminent as a
chronicler and known as a lover of the legends of
his own Breton race. Robert of Gloucester’s close
connection, as thus indicated, with both South Wales
and Normandy at once suggests that he must have
taken a considerable interest in Welsh and Breton
legendary lore. It is even possible that it was at his
instance that Walter, the archdeacon, and Geoffrey
embarked upon the quest which ultimately led to the
discovery, real or alleged, of the “book in the British
tongue,” and to its translation into Latin. It is
obvious that Geoffrey, at any rate, was at pains to
produce a work which would please both his immediate
patron and all courtly readers who took
pride in the growth of the Norman dominion.</p>

<p>A plausible, and by no means improbable, explanation
of Geoffrey’s motive in compiling the <i>Historia</i>
is that he meant it to be a kind of “national epos,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
blazoning the united glories of the composite Anglo-Norman
“empire” which reached the zenith of its
power under Henry II.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> A book written with such
a patriotic purpose would certainly commend itself
to Robert of Gloucester and other Norman lords,
and would appeal strongly to the imagination of
less exalted readers. The <i>History</i> does, indeed,
provide in Arthur a hero over whose achievements
Norman and Saxon, Welshman and Breton, could
all alike exult. Moreover, the common ancestry of
the various constituent races of the Angevin empire
is shown by an account of their descent from a
branch of the great Trojan stock which founded
imperial Rome. Brutus, the son of Æneas, stands
to Britain in the same relation as Æneas himself
stands to Rome, with the exception—and that was,
of course, to the advantage of Britain—that Brutus
could be claimed as the eponymous hero of this
island.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Thus—as poets like Wace and Layamon,
and certain Welsh chroniclers, who use the name,
were quick to see—here was a <i>Brut</i>, which, though
written in prose, had as good a right to its epic title
as the <i>Æneid</i>. There is, even, some evidence that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
Geoffrey may, at one time, have cherished the
ambition of emulating Virgil himself by telling his
story in verse; for, in the eleventh chapter of his
first book, we come across certain elegiac lines which
look uncommonly like fragments rescued from a
projected poem. Apart, however, from its account
of the coming of Brutus, there is little in Geoffrey’s
<i>Brut</i> that furnishes any real analogy with the <i>Æneid</i>.
It is not Brutus, but Arthur, who stands out as
the hero of the <i>Historia Regum Britanniæ</i>. The
<i>Historia</i> covers, altogether, a period—according, of
course, to the computation of its author—of some
fifteen hundred years; but more than a fifth part
of it is devoted to the record of Arthur’s life,—more
than twice the space allotted to the history of Brutus.
It is upon the story of Arthur that Geoffrey seems
to concentrate all his powers, and, by magnifying the
continental conquests of the British king, he is able
ultimately to point with triumph to the fulfilment
of a prophecy that “for the third time should one of
British race be born who should claim the empire of
Rome.”</p>

<p>The main objection to this theory of an Anglo-Norman
“epos” is the difficulty of reconciling it,
not so much with the Trojan and the Arthurian parts
of the <i>Historia</i> as with the scope and character of the
work as a whole. The book is called a <i>History of
the Kings of Britain</i>, and would appear, <i>primâ facie</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
to have been composed by a writer of British birth
for the sole purpose of glorifying the forgotten heroes
of his own race.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> Through six books the narrative
is strictly confined to the insular history of Britain
and its rulers, many strange legends and marvels
being interwoven with what professes to be an
authentic and ordered record of actual events.
Even in the first half of the <i>History</i>, dull though
it is for the most part, one alights upon many
passages which betray the hand of the deliberate
romancer. But it is only with the introduction, in
the seventh book, of the prophecies of Merlin that
Geoffrey finds his real opportunity for romantic
dilatation. With Merlin he is in the very heart of
the land of enchantment, and the spell of romance
inevitably falls upon him. It is to Merlin’s magic
arts that the birth is due of “the most renowned
Arthur, who was not only famous in after years, but
was well worthy of all the fame he did achieve by his
surpassing prowess.” Then follows, in three books,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
the narrative which first revealed to an astonished
world that Britain once had a hero whose deeds
challenged comparison with those of Alexander and
Charlemagne. Here, at last, was historical confirmation
of what had long been fabled in “the idle
tales” and “ancient songs” of the Britons. Here,
also, was just what a romantic age was thirsting for,
and Arthur immediately became the central figure
of the most popular and the most splendid of the
romantic cycles. “Alexander”—and, we may add,
Charlemagne—“had been an amusement; Arthur
became a passion.”<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>Geoffrey’s <i>History</i>, to be properly understood,
must thus be read in the light of the general literary
history of its time. Romance was in demand, and
Geoffrey was shrewd enough to perceive the romantic
value of the story of Arthur. It is impossible to read
the Arthurian chapters in his Book without feeling
that the writer is conscious of having got hold of
“a good thing,” and that he is determined to make
the most of it. So he gives his imagination free
play, and palpably expands and embellishes his
matter as he goes on. The <i>Historia</i> is much more
of a romance than a sober chronicle, and it is quite
conceivable that, in an age of literary experiment,
its author enjoyed the use to which he was thus
putting the time-honoured form of the chronicle.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
It is not, of course, suggested that Geoffrey invented
all, or even the greater part, of his matter; nor need it
be believed that the reference to “the British book” is
altogether a ruse. Like other chroniclers, he borrows
largely from his predecessors; what he has taken
from Nennius and Bede, for example, can be clearly
traced in his text. But the <i>History</i> obviously
contains much which Geoffrey either invented, or of
which he was unwilling to disclose the secret source.
It is otherwise unaccountable that he should warn
orthodox and reputable chroniclers, like William of
Malmesbury and Henry of Huntingdon, not to pry
into the romantic enclosure which was his own
particular preserve. In his epilogue, Geoffrey tells
these two eminent historians that they may go on
writing about “the kings of the Saxons,” if they
choose, but he “bids them be silent as to the kings
of the Britons, since they have not that book in the
British speech which Walter, archdeacon of Oxford,
brought over from Brittany.”</p>

<p>Of scarcely less significance than his epilogue, as
throwing a light upon the general character of the
work, is Geoffrey’s introductory chapter. Its apologetic
tone is distinctly suspicious, and seems intended
to disarm the critical by vouching an authority,
both ancient and written in a strange tongue, for the
marvellous narrative that was to follow and for the
ornate style in which it was presented. It is worth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
quoting in full, for it really strikes the keynote to
the entire work.</p>

<p>“Oftentimes in turning over in mine own mind the
many themes that might be subject-matter of a book,
my thoughts would fall upon the plan of writing a
history of the Kings of Britain; and in my musings
thereupon meseemed it a marvel that, beyond such
mention as Gildas and Bede have made of them in
their luminous tractate, nought could I find as concerning
the kings that had dwelt in Britain before the
Incarnation of Christ, <i>nor nought even as concerning
Arthur</i> and the many others that did succeed him
after the Incarnation, albeit that their deeds be
worthy of praise everlasting, and be as pleasantly
<i>rehearsed from memory by word of mouth in the
traditions of many peoples</i> as though they had been
written down. Now, whilst I was thus thinking
upon such matters, Walter, Archdeacon of Oxford,
a man learned not only in the art of eloquence, but
in the histories of foreign lands, offered me a certain
most ancient book in the British language that did
set forth the doings of them all in due succession and
order from Brute, the first king of the Britons,
onward to Cadwallader, the son of Cadwallo, <i>all told
in stories of exceeding beauty</i>. At his request, therefore,
albeit that never have I gathered gay flowers
of speech in other men’s little gardens and am
content with mine own rustic manner of speech and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
mine own writing-reeds, have I been at pains to
translate this volume into the Latin tongue. For,
had I besprinkled my page with high-flown phrases,
I should only have engendered a weariness in my
readers by compelling them to spend more time over
the meaning of the words than upon understanding
the drift of my story.”</p>

<p>Then follows the dedication to Robert of Gloucester.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
Having thus given us his authority, and
having taken further shelter under the wing of
Walter, Geoffrey settles down to his task with all
the gravity of a pious monkish chronicler. As other
chroniclers had done before him, he, in his early
books at least, makes brief references—as, apparently,
so many “guarantees of good faith”—to contemporaneous
events in sacred and profane history.
When, for example, Gwendolen is said to have
handed over the sceptre to her son Maddan, we learn
that “Samuel the prophet reigned in Judæa, and
Homer was held to be a famous teller of histories
and poet.” Carlisle, we are told, was founded at the
time when “Solomon began to build the temple of
the Lord in Jerusalem.” “The fortress of Mount<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
Paladur, which is now called Shaftesbury,” was
built by Hudibras, when “Haggai, Amos, Joel and
Azarias did prophesy.” We get, in the account of
the building of Shaftesbury, a characteristic example
of Geoffrey’s way of getting level with the sceptical
reader. “There, while the wall was a-building, an
eagle spake, the sayings whereof, had I believed
them to be true, I would not have shrunk from
committing to memory along with the rest.”</p>

<p>It is time, however, to give some account of
Geoffrey’s narrative of the life of Arthur. He was,
we are told, the son of Uther Pendragon<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> by
Igerne, the lawful wife of Gorlois, duke of Cornwall.
Uther is introduced to us as the brother of Aurelius
Ambrosius, and becomes, on the death of Aurelius,
king of Britain. After conquering the Saxons
under Octa and Eosa, and strengthening his kingdom
generally, he falls in love with Igerne and
quarrels with her husband. He, thereupon, makes
war upon Gorlois and besieges him in the castle
of Dimilioc. Igerne had, in the meantime, been
sent for safer refuge to the neighbouring castle of
Tintagel, on the sea-coast. Thither Uther, transformed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
into the semblance of Gorlois by Merlin’s
magic powers, proceeds in quest of her; he gains
ready admission, and so becomes the father of
Arthur. Immediately afterwards Gorlois, in a sally
from Dimilioc, is killed, and in due time Uther
marries Igerne. Another child born unto them was
a daughter, Anna, who became the wife of “Lot
of Lodonesia,” and the mother of Gawain and
Modred. After another campaign against Octa
and Eosa, Uther is poisoned by the Saxons, and
Arthur succeeds to the throne. He is crowned by
Dubricius, “archbishop of the City of Legions,”<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
and is thus portrayed as he was at the time of his
coronation. “At that time Arthur was a youth
of fifteen years, of a courage and generosity beyond
compare, whereunto his inborn goodness did lend
such grace as that he was beloved of well-nigh all
the peoples of the land. After he had been invested
with the ensigns of royalty, he abided by his ancient
wont, and was so prodigal of his bounties as that
he began to run short of wherewithal to distribute
amongst the huge multitude of knights that made
repair unto him. But he that hath within him a
bountiful nature along with prowess, albeit that he
be lacking for a time, natheless in no wise shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
poverty be his bane for ever. Wherefore did
Arthur, for that in him did valour keep company
with largess, make resolve to harry the Saxons,
to the end that with their treasure he might make
rich the retainers that were of his own household.”
Thus it comes about that Arthur begins his career
of conquest at once. He attacks the Saxon chieftains
Colgrin, Cheldric and Baldulph, and with the
help of his nephew Hoel, king of Armorica, subdues
them after several battles—including the twelve
recorded by Nennius—of which the last is fought
in “the country about Bath.” Arthur himself,
carrying “on his shoulder the shield Priwen,”
and armed with Ron, his spear, and “Caliburn,
best of swords, that was forged within the Isle of
Avalon,” performed prodigies of valour in that
battle. “Whomsoever he touched, calling upon
God, he slew at a single blow, nor did he once
slacken in his onslaught until that he had slain
four hundred and seventy men single-handed with
his sword Caliburn.” Having restored the whole
island to its pristine British dignity, Arthur, we
read, “took unto him a wife born of a <i>noble Roman
family</i>, Guenevere, who, brought up and nurtured
in the household of Duke Cador (of Cornwall),
did surpass in beauty all the other dames of the
island.”<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> His marriage only stimulated Arthur<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
to attempt, and achieve, further conquests; and,
in rapid succession, Ireland, Iceland, Gothland,
and the Orkneys, are either subdued or forced to
pay tribute to him. Then follow twelve years of
peace, during which his court waxed in splendour,
and his renown spread until “at last the fame of
his bounty and his prowess was on every man’s
tongue, even unto the uttermost ends of the earth,
and a fear fell upon the kings of the realms oversea
lest he might fall upon them in arms and they
might lose the nations under their dominion.”
Hence, one is not surprised to learn that Arthur’s
“heart was uplifted for that he was a terror unto
them all, and he set his desire upon subduing the
whole of Europe unto himself.” Norway, Dacia and
Gaul are invaded, and quickly reduced to submission.
Lot, his sister’s husband, is given what
was his of ancestral right, the crown of Norway,
just at the time, as we are told incidentally,
when “Gawain, the son of Lot, was a youth of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
twelve years, and had been sent by his uncle to
be brought up as a page in the service of Pope
Sulpicius.” Arthur’s visit to Gaul led to a single
combat between him and a man of giant stature,
Flollo, “Tribune of Rome”; the British king
was wounded in the fight, but at last “raising
Caliburn aloft” he clove Flollo’s head “sheer in
twain.” He concluded his business in Gaul by
giving “Neustria, which is now called Normandy,
unto Bedevere, his butler, and the province of
Anjou unto Kay, his seneschal.”</p>

<p>Returning to Britain, Arthur holds high court
at Caerleon-upon-Usk, and in the descriptions of
the state that he kept there the colour and pomp
of the age of chivalry, and of Norman court-life,
run unchecked through Geoffrey’s narrative. Even
before he had embarked upon his continental
conquests, Arthur had begun to “hold such courtly
fashion in his household as begat rivalry amongst
peoples at a distance, insomuch as the noblest in
the land, fain to vie with him, would hold himself
as nought, save in the cut of his clothes and
the manner of his arms he followed the pattern
of Arthur’s knights.” But, so far, nothing has
been heard of “the City of Legions,” except that
Dubricius was “archbishop” there. Now, however,
we are given a picture of the town “situate
on a passing pleasant position on the river Usk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
in Glamorgan,” which Arthur chose to be the
seat of his court, and to be the scene of the
“high solemnity” of his second, and seemingly imperial,
coronation. The city “abounded in wealth”
above all others; ships came to it from oversea;
its kingly palaces challenged comparison with
those of Rome itself; it was the third metropolitan
see of Britain, and “had, moreover, a school of two
hundred philosophers learned in astronomy and
in the other arts, that did diligently observe the
courses of the stars, and did by true inferences
foretell the prodigies which at that time were about
to befall unto King Arthur.” To the coronation
were bidden princes and warriors from every part
of the British islands and from realms oversea,
until “not a single prince of any price on this side
Spain remained at home and came not upon the
proclamation.” The description of the splendours
of the ceremonial itself, and of the banquet that
followed it, taxes Geoffrey’s rhetorical powers to
the full. He has, indeed, to give up in despair any
attempt to give a complete account of them;
“were I to go about to describe them,” he writes,
“I might draw out this history into an endless
prolixity.” “For at that time Britain was exalted
unto so high a pitch of dignity as that it did surpass
all other kingdoms in plenty of riches, in luxury of
adornment, and in the courteous wit of them that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
dwelt therein. Whatsoever knight in the land was
of renown for his prowess did wear his clothes and
his arms all of one same colour. And the dames,
no less witty, would apparel them in like manner
in a single colour, nor would they deign have the
love of none save he had thrice approved him in
the wars. Wherefore at that time did dames wax
chaste and knights the nobler for their love.”</p>

<p>Here is a passage that must have delighted the
hearts of Norman readers nurtured upon ideals of
chivalry and courtly love, and seems as though
designed to prepare the way for Arthur’s entry into
the kingdom of chivalric romance. It is no great
step from Arthur’s court, as here pictured, to the
knightly fellowship of the Round Table, and all
the other elaborate fictions of professional romantic
scribes. Of a part with all this romantic presentment
of the pomp and state surrounding the
British king is Geoffrey’s constant exaltation of his
“bounty,” and of his individual prowess as a
warrior. Nor is the element of wonder lacking
in the narrative given of Arthur’s exploits. He
encounters at St Michael’s Mount, and slays by his
own hand, a Spanish “giant of monstrous size,”
who had carried away and killed the niece of Hoel,
duke of Armorica. This adventure leads him to
tell Kay and Bedivere, who had accompanied him
on the expedition, how he had once, in Wales,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
despatched another formidable monster, “the
giant Ritho,” of Mount Eryri, “who had fashioned
him a furred cloak of the beards of the kings he
had slain.” Again, in the last battle with the
Romans, he is a truly Homeric hero. “He dashed
forward upon the enemy, flung them down, smote
them,—never a one did he meet, but he slew either
him or his horse at a single buffet. They fled from
him like sheep from a fierce lion madly famishing
to devour aught that chance may throw in his way.
Nought might armour avail them but that Caliburn
would carve their souls from out them with their
blood.”</p>

<p>The campaign against the Romans, undertaken
with an army of “eighty-three thousand two
hundred, besides those on foot, who were not easy
to reckon,” seems to have followed close upon the
festivities at Caerleon.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> The Romans were under
the command of “Lucius Hiberius, procurator
of the Commonwealth,” who, summoning to his
aid “the kings of the East,” put into the field
a host numbering “four hundred thousand one
hundred and sixty.” It is unnecessary here to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
give any detailed account of the fighting, and of the
final discomfiture of the Roman forces. It need
only be said that the British triumph was obtained
at heavy cost. Among the slain were the faithful
Kay and Bedevere,—in death, as in life, not divided.
Bedevere was buried at Bayeux, “his own city
that was builded by Bedevere the first, his great-grandfather;”
Kai was laid to rest near Chinon,
“a town he himself had builded.” The chief
disaster to the Romans was the loss of their leader
Lucius, whose body Arthur “bade bear unto the
Senate with a message to say that none other
tribute was due from Britain.” Arthur designed
to follow up this message by a march upon Rome
itself, and he had actually begun to climb the
passes of the Alps when news reached him that
“his nephew Modred, unto whom he had committed
the charge of Britain, had tyrannously and
traitorously set the crown of the kingdom upon his
own head, and had linked him in unhallowed union
with Guenever the Queen in despite of her former
marriage.”</p>

<p>So ends Geoffrey’s tenth book. “Hereof” begins
the eleventh, strangely enough,—but, of course,
plainly referring to the affair of Guinevere,—“verily,
most noble Earl, will Geoffrey of Monmouth
say nought.” He will only treat of the
battles which Arthur, after his return to Britain,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
fought with his nephew, according to the account
given “in the British discourse aforementioned,”
and what he “<i>hath heard</i> from Walter of Oxford,
a man of passing deep lore in many histories.”<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
The final, and fatal, battle did not take place all
at once; it came at the end of a campaign of some
length. Modred, retreating rapidly into Cornwall,
is at last brought to bay on the river Camel, and is
slain in a battle in which “well-nigh all the captains
that were in command on both sides rushed into
the press with their companies and fell.” And
“even the renowned King Arthur himself was
wounded deadly, and was borne thence unto the
island of Avalon for the healing of his wounds,
where he gave up the crown of Britain unto his
kinsman Constantine, son of Cador, duke of Cornwall,
in the year of the incarnation of our Lord
five hundred and forty-two.”</p>

<p>“Borne unto the island of Avalon for the healing
of his wounds,”—here, surely, are words never
before used in a professedly historical narrative
of a kingly hero wounded unto death. This
touch, alone, is sufficient to attest the kinship of
Geoffrey’s “history” of Arthur with the waifs
and strays of Celtic romance. The circumstances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
of Arthur’s birth, as told by Geoffrey, were
marvellous enough; like other saga-heroes, such
as Finn and Cormac, he was born out of
wedlock, through Merlin’s magical intervention.
But what caught the imagination of poets and
romancers even more was the fable of his “return.”
“Some men say yet,” writes Malory, “that
King Arthur is not dead, but had by the will
of our Lord Jesu into another place. And men
say that he shall come again, and he shall win
the holy cross. I will not say it shall not be
so, but rather I will say, here in this world he
changed his life. But many men say that there
is written upon his tomb this verse, <i>Hic jacet
Arthurus Rex quondam Rexque futurus</i>.” Later in
the twelfth century an attempt was made, at the
instance—so it is alleged—of Henry II to destroy
the persistent belief in this “Celtic messiahship”
by an announcement that the body of Arthur
had been exhumed at Glastonbury by the monks
of St Dunstan’s abbey.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> It was, however, of no
avail. A poet of the next generation, Layamon,
tells us that “the Britons believe yet that Arthur
is alive, and dwelleth in Avalon with the fairest
of all elves, and ever yet the Britons look for
Arthur’s coming.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>The popularity of Geoffrey’s <i>History</i> was immediate
and immense; it is indeed difficult to find
a parallel to it before the age of printed books.
So much is largely attested by the number of
extant MS copies of the work.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> But the most
striking evidence of the impression it made is to
be found in the number of translations, adaptations
and continuations of the <i>Historia</i> compiled from
the moment of its first appearance down to comparatively
recent times. Not long, if at all, after its
author’s death, Geoffrey Gaimar translated it into
Anglo-Norman verse.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> By 1155 Wace had completed
his <i>Brut</i>, which in substance is almost entirely
based on Geoffrey’s <i>Historia</i>. Early in the next
century Layamon wrote his English <i>Brut</i>, embodying,
with many interesting additions and
embellishments of his own, the main features of
Geoffrey’s and Wace’s narrative. Then follow a
long line of English chroniclers, in both prose and
verse, from Robert of Gloucester down to Grafton
and Holinshed, who pass on Geoffrey’s fables as
authentic history. In the Elizabethan age, in spite
of attempts made to discredit him by critics and
antiquaries, like Polydore Vergil and Camden,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
Geoffrey continues to be drawn upon by the poets.
Sackville and Spenser, Warner and Drayton, and
others, give a new currency to his British legends,
and Drayton even goes out of his way to defend
his impugned reputation.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> Spenser, in borrowing
from his record of British kings, pays him a well-known
tribute in the second book of <i>The Faerie
Queene</i>. But, perhaps, the finest tribute of all
to Geoffrey’s <i>History</i> is that of Wordsworth in
‘Artegal and Elidure,’ where he sings of the
“British record” in which</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent3">“We read of Spenser’s fairy themes,</div>
<div class="verse">And those that Milton loved in youthful years;</div>
<div class="verse">The sage enchanter Merlin’s subtle schemes;</div>
<div class="verse">The feats of Arthur and his knightly peers;</div>
<div class="verse">Of Arthur, who, to upper light restored,</div>
<div class="indent3">With that terrific sword</div>
<div class="verse">Which yet he brandishes for future war</div>
<div class="verse">Shall lift his country’s fame above the polar star!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Although Geoffrey’s book found so much acceptance
in his own time and afterwards, it is significant
to note that, even soon after its appearance
and in the very heyday of its repute, a few
shrewd critics ventured to question its authenticity.
William of Newburgh, as we have seen, denounced
it unreservedly as a tissue of impudent lies. He,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
at any rate, had no scruple in treating the work as
a deliberate experiment in fiction under the guise
of a chronicle. A different attitude towards the
book might have been expected from Giraldus
Cambrensis, a Welshman proud of his race and of
its “old and haughty” traditions, who was himself
not unskilled in the art of fiction. Yet it is Gerald
who, of all Geoffrey’s critics, says much the unkindest
thing on record of the <i>Historia</i>. He tells
us of a Welshman at Caerleon named Melerius, or
Meilir, who had dealings with evil spirits, and was
“enabled through their assistance to foretell future
events.” “He knew when anyone spoke falsely
in his presence, for he saw the devil as it were
leaping and exulting on the tongue of the liar....
If the evil spirits oppressed him too much, the
Gospel of St John was placed on his bosom, when,
like birds, they immediately vanished; but when
that book was removed, and the <i>History of the
Britons</i> by Geoffrey Arthur was substituted in its
place, they instantly reappeared in greater numbers,
and remained a longer time than usual on his body
and on the book.”</p>

<p>Geoffrey, in the epilogue to his <i>History</i>, hands over
the task of writing of “the kings who succeeded in
Wales” from the time at which his narrative closes
to “Caradoc of Llancarvan, my contemporary.”
Caradoc was an undoubted Welshman, but no Latin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
continuation by him of Geoffrey’s chronicle dealing
with the Welsh kings is known to exist, and it is
very doubtful whether a Welsh compilation bearing
his name, and bringing Geoffrey’s narrative down
to the year 1156, is a genuine work of his. It is,
however, highly probable that he was the author of
the Latin <i>Life of Gildas</i>, preserved in a twelfth
century MS now in the library of Corpus Christi
College, Cambridge. This work is of peculiar
interest as containing certain Arthurian traditions
which were apparently unknown to Geoffrey. Gildas
is represented, in this fictitious biography, as being
a contemporary of Arthur, king of all Britain, whom
he loved and obeyed. He had, however, twenty-three
refractory brothers who refused allegiance to
Arthur, and the eldest of them, Hueil,<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> or Huel, King
of Scotland, fought a battle with him in “the isle
of Minau” and was killed. Gildas, who was in
Ireland at the time, was much distressed to hear
of this, but, as became a saint, he prayed for Arthur,
and, returning to Britain, granted the king the
pardon which he besought. Further on in the <i>Life</i>
we get a version, probably the earliest in literature,<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
of the story of the abduction of Guinevere by Melwas
(the Mellyagraunce of Malory), “the wicked king
of the Summer Country,” or Somerset. After long
seeking for a convenient opportunity, Melwas carries
her violently away to Glastonia, or Glastonbury, a
place chosen by him as being apparently impregnable
because of the marshes around it. Arthur, discovering
her retreat, besieges Glastonbury with a
large army drawn from Cornwall and Devon. Before,
however, he and Melwas engage in battle, the monks
of the abbey, accompanied by Gildas, intervene;
peace is made, and the queen is restored to her
lawful husband.</p>

<p>Of the many chroniclers who, either in prose or
in verse, repeat and embellish Geoffrey’s Arthurian
narrative, by far the most interesting, and the most
important in their influence upon the literary
development of Arthurian story, are Wace and
Layamon. Both are poets, and their metrical <i>Bruts</i>
mark, as it were, the transitional stage between the
Arthur of history and traditional legend and the
Arthur of pure romance. Wace, according to
Layamon, dedicated his poem, which was completed
in 1155, to “the noble Eleanor, who was the high
King Henry’s queen.”<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> This statement—and there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
is no reason to doubt its truth—affords another
indication of the interest of the Angevin court in the
literary exploitation of “the matter of Britain.”
Geoffrey had already besought royal approval for
his presentment of British legends, and had done
his best to clothe his account of Arthur’s deeds in
the highly-coloured rhetorical trappings that would
commend it to courtly Norman readers. Wace
went further. He took Geoffrey’s matter and dressed
it up in a poetical form in French, thus giving it a
much more widespread currency than a Latin prose
chronicle could ever have done. Arthur becomes,
in his <i>Brut</i>, the flower of chivalry, and his entire
narrative is decorated in a way that would appeal
to the imagination of all knightly Anglo-Normans.
Nor is he without thought of the courtly ladies who
took so lively an interest in tales of chivalry. Like
Chrétien de Troyes and other romancers, he is at some
pains to elaborate his descriptions of scenes of love.
He takes delight in dwelling upon the accoutrements
of warriors, and upon their individual exploits in the
field. But it is not alone in such embellishments—the
deliberate attempts of a courtly writer to please
a courtly circle of readers—that Wace differs from
Geoffrey. He adds to his narrative many details
which indicate that he also had at his command an
independent fund of Arthurian traditions. Wace’s
literary celebrity is due, perhaps, most of all to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
fact that he is the first Arthurian writer to mention
the Round Table. “The Bretons,” he says, “tell
many a fable of the Table Round,” but he does not
explain whence such fables came, or where he heard
them told.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> He does, however, inform us that the
Table was made round because each of Arthur’s
knights thought himself better than his fellows, and
Arthur devised this method of settling all disputes
about precedence among them. The praise of the
knights of the Round Table, he adds in another place,
was loud throughout the world. Again, Wace adds
considerably to Geoffrey’s description of the passing
of Arthur. The king is not only taken to Avalon
“to be cured of his wounds,”—the Bretons confidently
expect his recovery, and look for his return.
“He is still there; the Bretons await him; they say
that he will come back and live again.”</p>

<p>Wace’s metrical chronicle formed the basis of
the still more elaborate, and the more poetical,
metrical <i>Brut</i> of the Englishman, Layamon,—the
most remarkable English contribution to Arthurian
literature until we come to <i>Sir Gawayne and the
Grene Knight</i>. Here we have a brave attempt to do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
what Caxton long afterwards desired,—to make
Arthur the best “remembered among Englishmen
before all other Christian kings.” Wace’s poem
was a contribution to the polite literature of the
Normans; Layamon’s, though his matter is so
largely borrowed from Wace, is a patriotic English
epic. It was his aspiration, as we learn from the
opening lines of his <i>Brut</i>, “to tell the noble deeds of
England,” and in his record of those deeds Arthur,
who had been all but denationalised by the romancers,
is restored to his fatherland and duly figures as the
great “Christian king of England.” But Layamon
was a poet no less than a patriotic chronicler, and
could not help listening to the blowings of “the
horns of Elfland.” Arthur’s prowess and royal
attributes were such as could not be explained
except for the intervention of superhuman powers.
Elves surrounded him when he came into the world;
it was from them that he derived the gifts which
made him the best of knights and the mightiest of
kings.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> Again, at his passing, Arthur says that he is
about to go to the splendid elf, Argante (Morgain, or
Morgan, <i>la fée</i>); “she will heal me of all my wounds,
and shall make me all hale; and afterwards I shall
come to my kingdom and dwell among the Britons
with mickle joy.”<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> Arthur’s byrnie was made for him
by Wygar, “the elvish smith”; his spear by Griffin,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
of the city of the wizard Merlin (Kaermerddin);
his sword, Caliburn, was wrought with magic craft
in Avalon; the Round Table was constructed
by a strange carpenter from oversea. Layamon’s
account of the Round Table is much fuller than that
of Wace, and is evidently based upon popular
legends of wizardry. It was in Cornwall, when there
was a quarrel among his knights, that Arthur met
the stranger from beyond the sea who offered to
“make him a board, wondrous fair, at which sixteen
hundred men and more might sit.”<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> Though it was
so large, and took four weeks to make, the table
could, by some magic means, be carried by Arthur
as he rode, and placed by him wherever he chose.
Layamon had evidently heard more about the Round
Table, “of which the Britons boast,” than he cares
to disclose in his poem; but “the Britons,” he tells
us at the end of his description of the Table, say
“many leasings” of King Arthur and attribute to
him things “that never happened in the kingdom
of this world.”</p>

<p>No more spirited, or more romantic, passage is to
be found in Layamon’s poem than that in which he
describes Arthur’s last battle. It was fought at
Camelford, “a name that will last for ever.” The
stream, hard by, “was flooded with blood unmeasured.”
The combatants were pressed so close<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
that they could not distinguish friend from foe;
“each slew downright were he swain, were he
knight.” Modred, and all his knights, were slain,
as were also “all the brave ones, Arthur’s warriors,
high and low, and all the Britons of Arthur’s board.”
None remained alive at the end of the battle,—and
they were two hundred thousand men who fought
there,—save Arthur and two of his knights. Arthur,
grievously wounded, bequeaths his kingdom to
Constantine, Cador’s son, and says that he himself
will go unto Avalon to be healed by Argante,<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> “the
fairest of all maidens.” And “even with the
words there came from the sea a short boat, borne on
the waves, and two women therein, wondrously
arrayed; and they took Arthur anon, and bare
him quickly, and softly laid him down, and fared
forth away. Then was brought to pass that
which Merlin whilom said, that there should be
sorrow untold at Arthur’s forthfaring. The Britons
believe yet that he is alive, and dwelleth in Avalon,
with the fairest of all elves, and ever yet the Britons
look for Arthur’s coming. Was never the man born,
nor ever of woman chosen, that knoweth the sooth,
to say more of Arthur. But whilom there was a
seer hight Merlin; he said with words—and his
sayings were sooth—that an Arthur should yet
come to help the Britons.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<small>ROMANCE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> the close of the twelfth century the Arthur
of popular legend, and of the chronicles, had been
transformed into a purely romantic hero. The
British king, soon after the appearance of Geoffrey’s
<i>History</i>, becomes the centre of the most profitably
worked of the cycles of mediæval romance. Much
of his individuality is, inevitably, lost in the process;
and that loss implies, no less inevitably, a gradual
obscuration of the primitive British environment
which originally surrounded him. The paramount
chief of early Britain, whose prowess and conquests
form the prime epic theme of Geoffrey and of
Layamon, appears as the king of no known realm,
numbering among his retainers heroic figures drawn
from the uttermost limits of the mythical world.
Exalted, as a world conqueror, to a level with
Alexander and Charlemagne, he becomes, like them,
largely lost to sight among the crowd of fabulous
characters called up around him by the professional
romancers. The Arthur of the romances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
is no more than a <i>primus inter pares</i>. He does,
indeed, stand above his knights by virtue of his royal
dignity,—he is still “King Arthur,” and the head
of a great Court. But our interest in his own personality
diminishes with the increasing accumulation
of exploits attributed to his knightly retinue.
The glory of the king is dimmed by the general
brilliance of his Court. It is as though the Round
Table, originally founded to put an end to all claims
of precedence among his knights, had had the result
of bringing Arthur himself into the unvalued “file.”
Knightly heroes, of whom little, or nothing, had been
heard before, enter the Arthurian circle, and perform
feats which interest us far more than anything done
by the king. In early Welsh tradition, and in
Geoffrey’s chronicle, Kay and Bedivere and, later,
Gawain, alone figure as warriors whose deeds are at
all worth mentioning by the side of Arthur’s. In
the romances, Kay and Bedivere play quite subordinate
parts, while Gawain becomes much more
prominent, only, however, to find his high station
challenged, and frequently usurped, by newcomers
such as Tristram and Perceval and Lancelot.</p>

<p>The cause of all this change is obvious. The age
of Chivalry had come, and the Arthurian stories
provided “the raw material” exactly suited to its
romantic literary requirements. The original Celtic
legends concerning Arthur and his few primitive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
“knights” lent themselves, at once, to adaptation
and embellishment by writers whose main concern
was with knight-errantry and courtly love; while
the conception of an Arthurian “court,” with its
fellowship of questing knights, invited the importation
into it of any and every legendary hero whose
story could in any plausible way be connected with
Arthur. They had another advantage which contributed
to their supreme popularity in the twelfth
and the thirteenth centuries. They had about them
an element of mystery, of magic, of indefiniteness,
coming as they did from the Celtic wonderland in the
West. The Arthurian kingdom had no geography,—it
was a “no man’s land,” which defied all cartography,
and the bounds of which could be extended
by each romantic writer at his will. It is true that
British tradition, and the bards and chroniclers who
had sought to give it literary form, associated Arthur’s
name with well-known localities in Great Britain;
but, even there, the “champion of Britain” had no
settled capital or court. London, the chief city of
the Norman kings, claimed him as her own; but so
did Winchester, Lincoln, York, Chester and Carlisle.
Then there was Caerleon-upon-Usk, the delectable
“metropolitan city” where Geoffrey of Monmouth
had definitely located his court in Wales. Moreover
places in Britain with mysterious legendary associations
came to be connected with Arthur’s name.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
Glastonbury, whither Joseph of Arimathea was
fabled to have brought the Holy Grail, was reputed
to be his burial-place, and the district around it was
identified with the mythical Avalon. The grim
old western castle of Tintagel was fixed upon as his
birthplace, and the tale of the battle on the Camel
led to the building, in poetic imagination,<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> of a
new Arthurian court at “tower’d Camelot.” The
name of Camelot at once suggests such purely
romantic regions as “the wild woods of Broceliande”
and “the sad sea-sounding wastes of Lyonesse.”<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>
Astolat, Cameliard, Sarras, Carbonek, Joyous Gard,
and other places, belong to the same romantic class,
and lie quite beyond geographical identification.
Stories, in which the characters thus roamed indifferently
among places well known to Norman
England and in regions which belonged entirely to
“the land of phantasy and illusion,” lay open to
the incursion of fabulous matter drawn from
many varied sources. In a word, the unrivalled
possibilities of “the matter of Britain” for all
kinds of romantic exploitation established for it
an easy supremacy over the other romantic themes,
and the literary uses to which it was put by writers
of romance throughout Western Europe all but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
robbed it, ultimately, of its distinctive features as a
native British growth.</p>

<p>The various stages in the romantic use and
adaptation of the Arthurian legends, mainly by
French writers, are not difficult to trace. First
of all, we get the metrical chronicles,—attempts to
put Geoffrey’s quasi-historical record into a poetical
form which much better suited its heroic theme
than the sober garb of Latin prose. Wace’s <i>Brut</i>,
completed in the year of Geoffrey’s death, is our
earliest extant example of this poetical treatment
of Arthurian story, and his work, as we have seen,
was written with a much more deliberate purpose
of pleasing courtly readers than Geoffrey’s. The
tastes and requirements of such readers, regarded
solely from the standpoint of their interest in knight-errantry
and romantic love, determine the character
of the second and the third phase which Arthurian
literature assumes. The metrical, and the prose,
French romances began to be written about the
same time, and from the same motive. It is generally
held, however, that the poetical romancers were
in the field before the prose writers: at any rate, the
most famous of the metrical romances—those of
Chrétien de Troyes—are earlier than any prose
romances which have come down to us. Chrétien,
in whom his admirers find the greatest mediæval
poet before Chaucer, wrote for the Norman aristocracy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
and especially for ladies, what were practically
the fashionable novels of the day. He dedicates
his <i>Chevalier de la Charrette</i> to the countess Marie of
Champagne, whose interest in everything appertaining
to the French cult of <i>l’amour courtois</i> is well
known; and all his poetical ‘novels’ are largely
designed for the entertainment of women eager
for literature of a more sentimental appeal than
sagas of monster-slayers and warriors. The sudden
appearance of the immortal love-stories of Tristan
and Iseult, and of Lancelot and Guinevere, shows
how triumphantly the French romancers responded
to the demands made of them.</p>

<p>Chrétien de Troyes’ share in the literary flotation
of both these stories entitles him to a place in the
history of pure Arthurian romance even above that
of Geoffrey of Monmouth. Geoffrey can claim,
beyond any question, to be the literary father of
King Arthur himself as a romantic hero. But the
Arthurian legend, as it emerged from mediæval
romance and as we know it in its modern presentment
by the poets, contains so much more than the
story of Arthur that the French romantic scribes
who brought Tristan and Lancelot and Perceval into
Arthur’s court must be regarded as the first artistic
fashioners of a purely poetic “matter of Britain.”
Among them Chrétien, and—if we are to take him
as the unquestioned author of the great prose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
<i>Lancelot</i> romance—Walter Map, stand pre-eminent.
As to Chrétien’s signal share in the work there is,
at any rate, no controversy, and his name is associated
with the poetical treatment of the stories of
each of the three celebrated heroes just mentioned.
He is believed<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> to have been the author of a lost
Tristan poem—probably his first work, composed
about 1160,—which is surmised to have been the
foundation of the long prose <i>Tristan</i> romance,
whence Malory drew much of his material. It is in
his <i>Chevalier de la Charrette</i> that we first hear of
Lancelot as a lover of Guinevere. His unfinished
<i>Conte del Graal</i> is one of the first literary presentations
of the story of Perceval.</p>

<p>Two other poems of Chrétien are, with the <i>Conte
del Graal</i>, of exceptional interest as bearing a close
relationship to three Welsh prose romances included
in <i>The Red Book of Hergest</i>, and translated by Lady
Charlotte Guest. The Welsh analogue of the <i>Conte
del Graal</i> is the so-called ‘mabinogi’ of <i>Peredur,
son of Evrawc</i>; while the Welsh tales called <i>Geraint,
son of Erbin</i>, and <i>The Lady of the Fountain</i> resemble,
in their main features, Chrétien’s two poems entitled
<i>Erec</i> and <i>Le chevalier au lion</i>. The Welsh romances,
as we have them, are undoubtedly of later date
than Chrétien’s poems, and bear such clear traces
of Norman-French influence as to have led many
critics to deny altogether their Celtic origin. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
they are neither translations, nor adaptations of
Chrétien’s works.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> The only explanation that meets
all the facts is that the French poems and the Welsh
tales follow an older and a simpler Celtic form of the
stories embodied in them, which was accessible both
to Chrétien and the Welsh writers.</p>

<p>Although by no means the best, the <i>Chevalier de la
Charrette</i> is perhaps the most interesting of Chrétien’s
extant works, for the reason that we obtain in it our
first literary introduction to the story of Lancelot of
the Lake. It treats, indeed, of only an episode in
that famous knight’s career, but that episode reveals
him to us as the lover of Arthur’s queen, and so
marks an important stage in the evolution of
Arthurian romance. In Chrétien’s poem, Guinevere
is abducted by Meleaguant,<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> the son of the king of a
land whence no man returns. Her rescue is accomplished
by Lancelot, who, in order to achieve his
object, has to ride in a cart used as a tumbril to
convey prisoners to execution; hence the name
given to him and to the poem, ‘The Knight of the
Cart.’ Welsh tradition knows nothing whatever
of the loves of Lancelot and Guinevere, although, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
we have seen, Guinevere did come to have in Welsh
folk-lore a doubtful reputation that somewhat
debased her name. It is in his Lancelot poem alone
that Chrétien suggests that Guinevere was anything
but a gracious and loving wife. Whence, then, did he
derive the story of her illicit relations with Lancelot?
Some see in it the influence of the Tristram legend,
in which passionate love breaks every bond. Others
attribute the invention of Lancelot as Guinevere’s
lover to the personal suggestion of Marie of Champagne,
who, according to Chrétien’s own account,
furnished him with the material for his poem.
Whatever may be the truth about its origin, the story
of Lancelot is an obvious, indeed the most signal,
example of the way in which the Arthurian legends
were adapted to suit the conceptions of chivalry.
We have in it a capital instance of what was implied
in the cult of “courtly love,” and hence it is not
surprising that among mediæval tales women, as
Chaucer informs us, held “in ful gret reverence the
boke of Lancelot de Lake.”<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> That book was not
Chrétien’s poem, but, much more probably, the
prose romance of <i>Lancelot</i>, usually assigned to
Walter Map. The same prose story, or one of its
adaptations, was presumably the book in which
Paolo and Francesca read, as related by Dante in the
Fifth Canto of his <i>Inferno</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>The prose <i>Lancelot</i> is a vast compilation embracing
what is really a series of romances, including a
version of the Grail story, and is attributed, on good
MS. authority, to the courtier Walter Map. If he
be indeed its author, he is entitled to as high a
pedestal in the Arthurian House of Fame as either
Geoffrey or Chrétien. The difficulty of accepting his
authorship of the work is not so much that he was
a very active public man, as that the one book of
which he is the indubitable author, the <i>De Nugis
Curialium</i>,—a sort of commonplace book in which
contemporary history finds a place side by side with
fairy tales, and much other odd lore,—does not
afford the slightest trace of interest in Arthurian
story. Map’s name was used to give a literary
passport to the notorious Goliardic poems gathered
from many cryptic sources in the thirteenth century,
and it may very well be that the ascription to him
of so wholly laudable a work as the <i>Lancelot</i> was
dictated by some too modest scribe’s desire for high
credentials.</p>

<p>The other great love-story of Arthurian romance,
that of Tristram and Iseult, is the most poetical and
the most poignant in tragic interest of all the tales
that came to be included in “the matter of Britain.”
The story of Lancelot, with all its charm and pathos,
betrays only too obviously its origin in the artificial
conventions of “courtly love.” The story of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
Tristram, on the other hand, is one of sheer, over-mastering,
natural passion,—the first really great
story of passionate romantic love in modern literature.
It is also, in its scene, its characters, its
colouring, a distinctively Celtic tale. Tristram<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> is
known to early Welsh tradition under the name of
Drystan, the son of Tallwch, as a purely mythical
hero; so also is Mark, or March ab Meirchion, who,
in the first literary versions of the story, appears
as King of Cornwall. The “proud, first Iseult,
Cornwall’s queen,”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“She who, as they voyaged, quaff’d</div>
<div class="verse">With Tristram that spiced magic draught,”</div>
</div></div>

<p>came from Ireland; while the other Iseult,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent4">“the patient flower,</div>
<div class="verse">Who possess’d his darker hour,</div>
<div class="verse">Iseult of the Snow-White hand,”<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></div>
</div></div>

<p>had her home in Brittany. The entire atmosphere
of the story is that of the western Celtic seaboard,
where lay the mystic land of Lyonesse, then
“unswallowed of the tides,” and</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent">“the wind-hollowed heights and gusty bays</div>
<div class="verse">Of sheer Tintagel, fair with famous days.”<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></div>
</div></div>

<p>Whence the French romancers derived the story it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
is impossible to say; but it is probable that it existed
in the form of scattered popular lays long before the
middle of the twelfth century. Fragments of two
<i>Tristan</i> poems by the Anglo-Normans, Béroul and
Thomas, otherwise known as Thomas de Bretagne,
have come down to us.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> These two poems were the
foundations, respectively, of the German metrical
versions of the story by Eilhart von Oberge and
Gottfried von Strassburg.</p>

<p>The most intricate, though not the least fascinating,
problem connected with the Arthurian legends is that
of accounting for the origin, and for the attachment
to the original Arthurian stock, of the story of the
Grail and its quest. Here, at any rate, we have
presented to us, in Tennyson’s words, “Soul at war
with Sense”; and it is clear enough that the gradual
manipulation of the Grail stories marks a deliberate
effort by ecclesiastical writers to neutralise the
influence of the dangerous ideals of chivalry upon
Arthurian romance. Celibacy had to be shown to
be compatible with true knighthood; there was no
reason why a knight-errant should make love, and,
all too often, illicit love, the sole motive of his quest
for adventure. So, we have ultimately created for
us the character of Galahad, who</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent2">“never felt the kiss of love</div>
<div class="verse">Nor maiden’s hand in his,”</div>
</div></div>

<p>and who alone, by virtue of his purity, is allowed to
“find the Holy Grail.” The earlier forms of the
Grail legend know nothing of Galahad, nor is there
any reason for supposing that they had any religious
significance. Gawain, apparently,—he who, in his
progress through the romances, degenerates so much
as to be finally described as “light in life and light
in death,”<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>—was the original hero of the Grail
quest. It is Perceval, however, who is the central
figure of the best-known versions of the story—as,
for example, the <i>Conte del Graal</i>, the Welsh <i>Peredur</i>,
and Wolfram von Eschenbach’s <i>Parzival</i>. But
Perceval was not immaculate, and so had to be superseded
by one who “exemplified, in a yet more
uncompromising, yet more inhuman, spirit, the ideal
of militant asceticism,”<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>—the virginal and youngest
knight of the Round Table, Galahad. And, in order
to establish Galahad’s right to a place in the
Arthurian fellowship, he is introduced as the son of
Lancelot. Here is an artistic touch deserving much
more appreciation than it has yet generally received.
The sin of Lancelot is largely expiated by the unsullied
purity of his son. Truly, the “militant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
ascetics” knew their romantic business as well as
the best of the secular scribes.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>It is unnecessary, here, to outline the various
ramifications of the Grail legend, or to summarise
the conflicting theories advanced as to its origin
and meaning. It comes to be connected with
Arthur’s court mainly through the knightly Perceval,
who, though ultimately deposed as the Grail hero by
Galahad, remains to the end the real protagonist of the
story. The Grail romances are usually divided into
two classes,—one dealing with the “Quest” proper,
and the other with the “Early History” of the Holy
Grail. In the “Quest” group of stories—three of
which have been named above—the main interest
lies in the personality of Perceval, and in his adventures
in search of certain talismans, which include a
sword, a bleeding lance and a “grail,” the latter, in
Chrétien’s poem, a magic vessel, in Wolfram’s, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
stone. The “Early History” group—of which the
chief representatives are the <i>Joseph of Arimathea</i>
and the <i>Merlin</i> of Robert de Borron, and the <i>Quête
del St Graal</i> attributed to Map,—dwell chiefly upon
the origin and nature of these talismans. The Grail
legends, as given in these and other romances, and so
far as they can be put into a coherent whole, are
undoubtedly a compound of remote mythical and
pagan elements, probably Celtic,<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> and of later
accretions due to monastic writers deliberately bent
upon edification. A flagrant example of the way in
which the legends were turned to ecclesiastical uses
is furnished by the identification of the Grail with
the cup of the Last Supper, which Pilate gave to
Joseph of Arimathea, and in which Joseph treasured
the blood that flowed from the Saviour’s wounds
on the Cross. Joseph brought this cup to Britain,
and thus the Grail came to be connected with the
mythical story which attributed to Joseph the first
evangelisation of these islands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>It has been said that Gawain was, in all probability,
the original hero of the Grail quest.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> Whatever the
truth may be about that matter, there can be no
doubt that Gawain is the most famous of all the
knights grouped around Arthur in pre-romantic
tradition. He figures largely in the Welsh Triads
and in the <i>Mabinogion</i> under the name of Gwalchmei,
and in the story of Arthur’s wars as told by
Geoffrey he is the king’s most powerful lieutenant.
Originally a mythical hero, he was probably the
centre of a cycle of traditional stories as old as, if
not older than, anything fabled or sung of Arthur.<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>
No other knight of the Arthurian court is the hero
of so many episodic romances and poems, while there
is no more prominent figure in Arthurian literature
generally. No other knight, however, is subjected
to such churlish treatment at the hands of the
romancers as he. In the earlier stages of Arthurian
story—in the <i>Mabinogion</i>, especially,—Gawain
appears as the very flower of chivalrous knighthood,
no less courteous and gracious than brave. His
degradation is due largely to the later manipulators
of the Grail legends, who could not brook the importance
attached to so worldly a character. Malory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
and Tennyson follow in their footsteps, until for
modern readers Gawain is branded with the words
put into the mouth of Bedivere in <i>The Passing
of Arthur</i>,—of Bedivere, who, as one of Gawain’s
oldest associates in Arthur’s service, ought to have
been spared the indignity of having attributed to him
so mean an aspersion upon a comrade in arms:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Light was Gawain in life, and light in death</div>
<div class="verse">Is Gawain, for the ghost is as the man.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Gawain, however, was the favourite Arthurian hero
in England up to Malory’s time,<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> and the finest
contribution to English Arthurian romance in the
Middle Ages,—<i>Sir Gawayne and the Grene Knight</i>,—dealing,
apparently, with an incident borrowed from
the earlier traditions about Gawain, does full
justice to him as a knight <i>sans peur et sans reproche</i>.</p>

<p>The most marvellous feature of Geoffrey of Monmouth’s
story of Arthur is the part played by the
wizard Merlin in the events that led to Arthur’s
birth. It is in Geoffrey’s <i>History</i> that we get, so
far as is known, the first definite association of
Merlin with the Arthurian legends. In subsequent
romance Merlin stands in the first file of Arthurian
characters, and his name is given to a group of
romances as important as any of those dealing with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
the adventures of the great knights mentioned in
the last few pages. In Welsh tradition Merlin, or
Myrddin, was famous as both a bard and a magician,
but the poetical compositions which bear his name
may safely be taken as spurious. Geoffrey exalts
him as a prophet as well, and the ‘Prophecies of
Merlin’ contributed largely to the renown of the
<i>History of the Kings of Britain</i>. Geoffrey’s authorship
is sometimes claimed for a Latin poem called
the <i>Vita Merlini</i>, and composed about 1148, which
tells much about the enchanter that is not always
easy to reconcile with the account of him given in
the <i>History</i>. The chief French romantic works
dealing with the Merlin legend are a fragmentary
poem, dating from the end of the twelfth century, and
supposed to be by Robert de Borron, and the prose
romance of <i>Merlin</i>, which exists in two forms known
as the “ordinary” <i>Merlin</i> and the <i>Suite de Merlin</i>,
of the latter of which Malory’s first four books
are an abridgment. In these romances we first
read of the enchanter’s own enchantment, how
he was, in Malory’s words, “assotted and doted”
on a “damosel of the lake,”—Ninien, or Nimue,
a name that in the latest forms of the story comes
to be Vivien. In these early French versions of
the Merlin legend, also, appears the first suggestion
that Modred was Arthur’s son. When the wife of
King Lot,—the daughter of Igerne by her first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
husband,—came to King Arthur’s court soon after
his coronation, Arthur fell in love with her, with the
result that Modred was born. Modred’s rebellion,
and the tragic end of Arthur himself, were thus
represented as a just retribution for the king’s
misconduct.</p>

<p>For English readers Malory’s <i>Morte Darthur</i> is
the book in which the various strands of romantic
matter reviewed in this chapter are woven into a
connected, though not always a coherently artistic,
texture. From a literary point of view, the relative
values of the various constituents of ‘The French
book’ whence Malory derived most of his material
are of little consequence. What really matter are
the style, the tone, the atmosphere of his own book;
and these are charged to the full with the subtle
magic of the enchanted land in which his borrowed
characters live and move. It is here that we
reap the harvest of mediæval romance, and catch,
in the beautifully quaint style of the narrative,
something of the fresh odour and mellow colouring
of the ripened corn. Of equally small importance
with the question of the precise identification and
the value of his sources is that of Malory’s general
motive, or plan. It may, indeed, be possible to find
in the book an epic in which “may be traced a
thread of destiny and providence, leading either to
a happy triumph over circumstance, or to a tragic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
doom.”<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> But it is for no such reason that the
<i>Morte Darthur</i> is valued by the modern reader. We
read Malory now both for “his style and his love,”—his
love of “King Arthur and his noble knights of
the Round Table,” attested so signally by his painful
zeal in garnering, and sifting, such a bewildering
crop, both rich and rank, of manuscript material.
His “style” is sufficiently near to the English of
to-day, but at the same time retains so much in both
vocabulary and grammar which the invention of
printing forced the language to reject, as to be an
almost ideal medium for the presentment to modern
English readers of what was storied in the verse and
prose of the age of high romance. Space does not
allow of our giving any extended specimens of
it here; but the reader may be referred, first,
to a passage where Malory appropriately embroiders
his narrative by expatiating upon “How
true love is likened to summer,”<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> and, secondly, to
the noble and pathetic chapter which tells of the
passing of Arthur.<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> Incidental felicities of style
could be quoted from almost every page of his
book. Bedivere, when returning from his pretended
attempt to “fling Excalibur,” tells Arthur that he
saw “nothing but the waters wap and the waves
wan.” Tristan, in a general fight, “fared among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
those knights like a greyhound among the conies”;
while, of another fight we read that “the best
of us all had been full cold at the heart-root had
not Sir Launcelot been better than we.” What,
again, could be in better chime with its theme than
this sentence from the account of Gawain’s fight
with Launcelot—“then Sir Gawaine deliberately
avoided his horse, and put his shield afore him, and
eagerly drew his sword, and bad Sir Launcelot,
Alight, traitor knight, for if this mare’s son hath
failed me, wit thou well a king’s son and a queen’s
son shall not fail thee”? Or, what more pathetic
than Guinevere’s words when Lancelot found her
in the nunnery at Almesbury—“Sir Launcelot,
wit thou well I am set in such a plight to get my
soul’s health; and yet I trust, through God’s grace,
that after my death to have a sight of the blessed face
of Christ, and at doomsday to sit on his right side,
for as sinful as ever I was are saints in heaven”?
But the entire work is studded with such gems, and
he who would know and revel in the richest treasures
of Arthurian romance should devote his days and
his nights to the reading of what is ingenuously, and
truly, styled in its epilogue, “this noble and joyous
book.”<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<small>ARTHUR IN ENGLISH LITERATURE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">English</span> Arthurian romance before Malory, with
the conspicuous exception of <i>Sir Gawayne and the
Grene Knight</i>—an alliterative poem composed in
the fourteenth century by an unknown author to
whom three other poems, <i>The Pearl</i>, <i>Cleanness</i>,
and <i>Patience</i>, are ascribed,—possesses little literary
charm or distinction. The wearisome monotony
and the generally jejune character of the common
metrical romances of his day, with their stereotyped
phraseology and futile rhymes, had probably as
much to do as anything with Chaucer’s attitude
towards the newer romantic matters. His <i>Tale of
Sir Thopas</i> is so openly contemptuous a burlesque
of the methods of the romantic rhymers of the time
that we may safely assume that the poet had little
more respect for their themes.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Into his sadel he clamb anon,</div>
<div class="verse">And priketh over stile and stoon</div>

<div class="indent">The contree of Fairye,” etc.</div>
</div></div>

<p>It was scarcely possible for one who could
write so irreverently as this of Elfland and its
denizens to attune himself to the mood required for
grave poetical treatment of Arthurian story. An
Arthurian setting of a sort is indeed given to <i>The
Wife of Bath’s Tale</i>; but the facetious tone of the
opening lines only too plainly reveals Chaucer’s sense
of the unreality of it all.</p>

<p class="center">“In tholdë dayes of the Kyng Arthour,”</p>

<p>he writes,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Al was this land fulfild of faërie.</div>
<div class="verse">The elf-queene with hir joly compaignye</div>
<div class="verse">Danced ful ofte in many a grenë mede.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>But, he adds, there are no fairies now; “lymytours
and other holy freres” have effectually driven them
away.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“For ther as wont to walken was an elf,</div>
<div class="verse">Ther walketh now the lymytour hymself.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>With the elves had gone the knights-errant, and
Chaucer’s poetical genius was not of the kind to
restore either to their original pride of place in
imaginative literature.</p>

<p>It was Malory who gave new life to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
Arthurian legends, and to him, more than to any
other writer, is due the fascination which Arthurian
story has had for so many modern English poets.
Malory’s book, as we know from Ascham’s testimony,
was exceedingly popular in the Elizabethan
age; but there were other causes of the interest
then so widely felt in ancient British legends.
Throughout the sixteenth century chroniclers were
busy in recording, and antiquaries in investigating,
the early annals of Britain; and, in the reign of
Elizabeth herself, the heightened patriotic feeling
of the day was a potent stimulus to all who sought
to discover material for, and to reconstruct from it,
the history of their country. Hence Geoffrey of
Monmouth’s Latin chronicle in its first printed forms
comes to be one of the most eagerly studied books
of the time. And it is, perhaps, not fanciful to find
in the new interest aroused in the annals and legends
of early Britain the influence of the reigning Tudor
dynasty. On what other grounds are we to account,
for example, for Spenser going out of his way to
remind Elizabeth that she can boast of a genuine
British ancestry, and that among her forebears is no
less a person than the great King Arthur himself?</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Thy name, O soveraine Queene, thy realme and race</div>
<div class="verse">From this renowned Prince derived arre,</div>
<div class="verse">Who mightily upheld that royall mace</div>
<div class="verse">Which now thou bear’st, to thee descended farre</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
<div class="verse">From mighty kings and conquerours in warre,</div>
<div class="verse">Thy fathers and great Grandfathers of old,</div>
<div class="verse">Whose noble deeds above the Northern starre</div>
<div class="verse">Immortall fame for ever hath enrold;</div>
<div class="verse">As in that old man’s booke they were in order told.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Here is a compliment of which Geoffrey, could he
have foreseen it, would have been as proud as of his
inclusion in Chaucer’s ‘Hous of Fame.’ To have
been singled out for honour as one “besy for to bere
up Troy” was much; it was more to be quoted,
by a poet no less illustrious, as an authority for the
Arthurian descent of the greatest of British queens.
The glorification of the House of Tudor, and of
Elizabeth’s Welsh descent, is obvious enough in the
lines in <i>The Faerie Queene</i> which refer to the
“sparke of fire” that shall</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">“Bee freshly kindled in the fruitfull Ile</div>
<div class="verse">Of Mona, where it lurked in exile:</div>
<div class="verse">Which shall breake forth into bright burning flame</div>
<div class="verse">And reach into the house that bears the stile</div>
<div class="verse">Of roiall majesty and soveraine name:</div>
<div class="verse">So shall the Briton blood their crowne agayn reclame.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Thenceforth eternal union shall be made</div>
<div class="verse">Betweene the nations different afore.”<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>In the second book of <i>The Faerie Queene</i> Spenser,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
following Geoffrey’s “auncient booke hight Briton
moniments,” gives a versified</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="indent3">“chronicle of Briton kings</div>
<div class="verse">From Brute to Uther’s rayne,”</div>
</div></div>

<p>thus further emphasising the newly-discovered
importance of early British history. The same
patriotic fervour accounts for the production of
such poems as William Warner’s <i>Albion’s England</i>
and Michael Drayton’s <i>Polyolbion</i>. Warner is
eminently practical, and, in his reproduction of
Geoffrey’s Arthurian narrative, leaves out its more
romantic incidents. Arthur’s</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Scottish, Irish, Almaine, French and Saxone battelles got</div>
<div class="verse">Yeeld fame sufficient: these seeme true, the reste I credite not.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Drayton is inclined to trust Geoffrey more implicitly,
and even takes up the cudgels on his
behalf against the critics who were then seeking
to disparage him. The “adversary says,” writes
Drayton, that “Geoffrey Monmouth first our Brutus
did devise,” whereas the fact is that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent2">“pregnantly we prove, ere that historian’s days,</div>
<div class="verse">A thousand-ling’ring years, our prophets clearly sung</div>
<div class="verse">The Britain-founding Brute.”<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></div>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>Drayton’s poem, so largely topographical as it is in
its character, affords him many opportunities of making
effective use of Arthurian traditions. When he
comes, for example, to the river Camel, he remembers
that Arthur was born as well as slain in that tract of
western country,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“As though no other place on Britain’s spacious earth</div>
<div class="verse">Were worthy of his end, but where he had his birth.”<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></div>
</div></div>

<p>Again, referring to the songs of the ancient Britons,
he tells us—much in Geoffrey’s manner—of Caerleon
with</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent6">“her temples and her groves,</div>
<div class="verse">Her palaces and walls, baths, theatres, and stoves.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>With all his garrulous “asides” and prosaic
disquisitions, Drayton’s <i>Polyolbion</i> is a well-intentioned
poem, and its sympathetic treatment of
the legends entitles it to an honoured place in the
Arthurian library. Like Caxton, Drayton bewails
the indifference of British poets to the wealth of
native tradition which lay ready for their use, and
regrets that a British Homer had not been found to
rise to “the height of its great argument”;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“For some abundant brain, oh, there had been a story,</div>
<div class="verse">Beyond the blind man’s might to have enhanced our glory.”</div>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>Although Elizabethan poets, from patriotic and
courtly motives, were so much interested in the early
British legends as presented to them by the English
chroniclers of their time, it is somewhat strange
that these legends, and Arthurian story in particular,
did not appeal strongly to the imagination of the
playwrights of our greatest dramatic period. The
only Arthurian drama of any consequence written
during the Elizabethan period was <i>The Misfortunes
of Arthur</i> by Thomas Hughes, which was acted
before the Queen in February 1588; and the plot of
that play is derived, in the main, not from Malory, but
from Geoffrey. In one important detail, however,
Hughes departs from Geoffrey’s narrative, and, like
many of the later romancers, represents Modred as
Arthur’s son; and he is in touch with Malory in
making the tragedy of Arthur’s doom the nemesis
that comes upon him for his sin. The drama, as a
whole, is a standard example of the Senecan type of
tragedy, so much in vogue at the time of its production,
and action and characterisation are altogether
subordinated in it to narration. Some life, however,
is given to the characters of the two protagonists,
Arthur and Modred; and the introduction
of the ghost of Gorlois at the beginning and at the
end of the play adds not a little to its general
dramatic effect. In his final speech the Ghost,
exulting over the ruin of the sinful house of Uther,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
is made to pay an adroit compliment to Queen
Elizabeth,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“That virtuous Virgo, born for Britain’s bliss,</div>
<div class="verse">That peerless branch of Brute,”</div>
</div></div>

<p>and gives utterance to the hope that she</p>

<p class="center">
“Shall of all wars compound eternal peace.”</p>

<p>We are still without a great English drama based
upon a theme drawn from Arthurian story; but
what the Elizabethan dramatists, and most of their
successors, rejected as either too unreal or too intractable
for their purposes, continued even down to the
Victorian age to haunt and challenge the imagination
of the poets.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“The mightiest chiefs of British song</div>
<div class="verse">Scorn’d not such legends to prolong”<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>;</div>
</div></div>

<p>and yet we possess no great Arthurian epic in English
verse any more than a drama. Milton and Dryden
both cherished the ambition of writing one, but both,
in different ways, found the pressure of circumstances
too strong for the accomplishment of their design.
When Milton, after the turmoil of the Civil Wars
and his entanglement in public controversy, once
more turned his attention to poetry, he had need of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
higher argument for his long-projected ‘heroic
poem’ than</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent8">“to dissect</div>
<div class="verse">With long and tedious havoc fabl’d knights</div>
<div class="verse">In battles feign’d.”<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></div>
</div></div>

<p>Arthurian memories, however, lingered with him to
the last, for even in <i>Paradise Regained</i> he cannot
help referring to what once charmed him in stories</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Of fairy damsels met in forest wide</div>
<div class="verse">By knights of Logres, or of Lyones,</div>
<div class="verse">Lancelot, or Pelleas, or Pellenore.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Dryden, again, who had aspired to write an
Arthuriad, as he tells us, “for the honour of his
native country,” found himself obliged to turn to
more immediately profitable forms of literature,—“being
encouraged only with fair words by Charles
II., my little salary ill-paid, and no prospect of a
future subsistence.”<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> But it is doubtful whether
he was quite the kind of poet who, in Scott’s words,
could</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent5">“in immortal strain</div>
<div class="verse">Have raised the Table Round again,</div>
<div class="verse">But that a ribald King and Court</div>
<div class="verse">Bade him toil on to make them sport.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Scott’s assumption, at any rate, is scarcely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
justified by the character of the “dramatic opera”
called <i>King Arthur, or the British Worthy</i>, which
Dryden composed shortly before Charles II.’s death.
This “opera” was written with a courtly, if not
exactly a patriotic, motive; it was meant to be a
glorification of King Charles’s public policy, but,
unfortunately, Charles died before any performance
of it could be given. It was produced on the stage,
ultimately, in 1691, to music by Purcell; but, at
that time, William and Mary were the reigning
sovereigns, so that the original point of the play was
lost, and it had to be “improved” to suit the
changed conditions of the day. Thus, what Scott
calls an “ingenious political drama” was turned
into “a mere fairy-tale” without “any meaning
beyond extravagant adventure.”<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> The story of
Arthur, also, is in many of its main features turned
in this play into something very different from its
familiar forms up to Dryden’s time. Several new
characters are introduced into it, the most notable
being a blind girl, Emmeline,—a creature of
Dryden’s own invention,—who, in defiance of all
tradition and of Guinevere’s well-attested rights,
becomes the wife of “the British Worthy.”</p>

<p>The Restoration age, despite its literary pre-occupation
with ‘heroic’ plays and ‘heroic’
poetry, was unpropitious for the production of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
romantic epic worthy of the Arthurian, or any other
similar theme. A brave attempt, however, to achieve
the impossible was made by “the City Bard or
Knight Physician,”<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> Sir Richard Blackmore, who in
1695 published <i>Prince Arthur, an Heroick Poem in
Ten Books</i>, and followed it up in 1697 with another
‘epic,’ in twelve books, called <i>King Arthur</i>. These
ponderous poems, written in heroic couplets, are
really political allegories, in which Arthur stands
for the Prince of Orange, and his Saxon enemy,
Octa, for James the Second. But they aim at
being ‘epics’ as well. Supernatural ‘machinery,’
evidently suggested in many of its details by <i>Paradise
Lost</i>, is introduced, and just as the gods used
to intervene in the struggles of the epic heroes of
antiquity, so angels like Uriel and Raphael watch
over the fortunes of Arthur. Indeed, the whole
heavenly host befriends him, while Lucifer and the
rebel angels are the patrons of his foes. Blackmore,
whatever else may be said on his behalf, can claim
to be at least faithful to the tradition which represents
Arthur as “the chief and best of the three
Christian kings,” for he makes him the supreme
champion of Christendom in his day:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“This great deliverer shall Europa save,</div>
<div class="verse">Which haughty monarchs labour to enslave;</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
<div class="verse">Then shall Religion rear her starry head,</div>
<div class="verse">And light divine through all the nations spread.”<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></div>
</div></div>

<p>But, alas, who now reads Blackmore? The world
generally is quite content not to know him, and
ready to echo Dryden’s pious wish—“peace be to the
<i>Manes</i> of his Arthurs.”</p>

<p>Blackmore, grotesque and even ludicrous though
his methods are of allegorising the Arthurian stories,
could, of course, claim high poetical sanction for this
particular use of them. Spenser had, long before,
“laboured to pourtraict in Arthure, before he was
king, the image of a brave knight, perfected in the
twelve private morall virtues, as Aristotle hath
devised,”<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> and had also, though somewhat obscurely,
sought to “shadow forth” in him “a modern
gentleman” of the Elizabethan court,—the Earl of
Leicester. There is not much to choose between
Leicester and William of Orange as “modern” types
of Arthur, but Spenser has, at least, succeeded in
giving a romantic glamour to his poem which helps
us to forget its allegorical intent and takes us back
to the legendary Arthur’s native “land of faerie.”
So, in <i>The Faerie Queene</i>, Arthur appears in a rôle
somewhat similar to that which he plays in the
romances as the helper and deliverer of sorely-beset
knights; and what the poet tells us about his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
person, his prowess, and his accoutrements is, in
spirit though not always in the letter, quite in
accord with romantic tradition. Delivered at birth
to a faery knight, “to be upbrought in gentle thewes
and martiall might,” he was put under the tutelage
of Timon,<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Old Timon, who in youthly yeares had beene</div>
<div class="verse">In warlike feates th’ expertest man alive,”</div>
</div></div>

<p>and who dwelt</p>

<p class="center">“Under the foot of Rauran mossy hore,”</p>

<p>—the Merionethshire mountain, Yr Aran, where the
river Dee has its source. “Thither,” so Prince
Arthur’s tale of his own history runs,—<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Thither the great magician Merlin came,</div>
<div class="verse">As was his use, oft-times to visit me;</div>
<div class="verse">For he had charge my discipline to frame</div>
<div class="verse">And Tutors nouriture to oversee.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>It was Merlin</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent5">“which whylome did excell</div>
<div class="verse">All living wightes in might of magick spell,”</div>
</div></div>

<p>who forged for Arthur his shield and sword and
armour. Spenser, however, departs from the
romancers in calling Arthur’s sword “Morddure,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span><a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>
and in stating, what is nowhere told of Excalibur,
that it could not be</p>

<p class="center">“forst his rightful owner to offend.”</p>

<p>Nor do we hear in the romances of such marvellous
details about the prince’s shield as those which
Spenser gives; it was made of “diamond perfect,
pure and cleene,” and when Arthur chose to
uncover it,</p>

<p>Spenser, again, finds none of the knights of the
Round Table suitable for the main purposes of his
allegory—the only prominent one who is brought
into the poem is Tristram, and he is introduced
only as quite a subordinate character. As the poet
expressly tells us in his prefatory letter that his
purpose is to “pourtraict” Arthur “before he was
king,” <i>The Faerie Queene</i>, even had it been completed,
could hardly have contained any reference
to the later, and more especially the tragic, features
of Arthurian story. Neither did Spenser’s general
design admit of any treatment of them. There
could be no Guinevere in his poem, as Arthur was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
destined at the end to marry Gloriana, the Fairy
Queen, in whom “I mean Glory in my generall
intention, but in my particular I conceive the
most excellent and glorious person of our soveraine
the Queene, and her kingdom in Faery land.”
There is indeed some excuse even for Blackmore’s
“particular intentions” in his egregious
epics when we remember that a really great poet was
capable of thus imagining Arthur, even in allegory,
as the husband of Queen Elizabeth.</p>

<p>The uses to which Spenser and Blackmore, each in
his own way, put the Arthurian legends are not, after
all, so dissimilar to those which underlie the most
popular, and on the whole the most successful,
poetical treatment of them in the nineteenth century.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
<i>The Idylls of the King</i> have a palpably symbolical,
not to say an allegorical, meaning, and “a message
for the times.” It may be that in no other way
could any new life be infused into stories of which
Swinburne says that “their day is done,”—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Their records written of the winds, in foam</div>
<div class="verse">Fly down the wind, and darkness takes them home.”<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></div>
</div></div>

<p>At any rate, Tennyson frankly confesses that what
he presents in his ‘Idylls’ is a</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent19">“tale</div>
<div class="verse">New-old, and shadowing Sense at war with Soul”;</div>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span></p>

<p>and the new element in it is a didactic purpose suited
to the moral and sentimental temper of the Victorian
era, and embodying what a severe critic calls “the
ethics of the rectory parlour.”<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> Tennyson himself
is responsible for revealing the “particular intention”
which equates the Arthur of the ‘Idylls’ with
the Prince Consort; for he dedicates the poems to
his memory,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent4">“since he held them dear,</div>
<div class="verse">Perchance as finding there unconsciously</div>
<div class="verse">Some image of himself.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>It is hardly likely, however, that Tennyson, when he
first thought of the Arthurian stories as a poetic
theme, had any very definite idea of putting
them into the form of an allegory such as most
of his interpreters now discover in them; but that
he, from the first, intended a “modern meaning”
is plain from the lines appended to the <i>Morte
D’Arthur</i> at the time of its original publication,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“To me, methought, who waited in a crowd,</div>
<div class="verse">There came a bark that, blowing forward, bore</div>
<div class="verse">King Arthur, like a modern gentleman</div>
<div class="verse">Of stateliest port; and all the people cried</div>
<div class="verse">‘Arthur is come again: he cannot die.’”</div>
</div></div>

<p>That the ‘Idylls,’ when finally completed and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
put into their present order, had “an allegorical or
perhaps a parabolic drift,” in them, is certain, for
the words quoted are Tennyson’s own.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> Tennyson,
however, complains that critics had “taken his
hobby and ridden it too hard, and have explained
some things too allegorically.” “The general drift
of the ‘Idylls,’” he continues, “is clear enough.
‘The whole ... is the dream of man coming into
practical life and ruined by one sin. Birth is a
mystery and death is a mystery, and in the midst
lies the tableland of life.’” Modern though this
“drift” may be, it is perennial and universal
enough in its appeal to save the ‘Idylls’—notwithstanding
the references to the “modern
gentleman” and the Prince Consort—from being
a merely Victorian poem, or series of poems.
They do not, together, constitute an Arthuriad:
they are not meant to represent “the epic, some
twelve books” with “faint Homeric echoes” which
Tennyson may have been meditating in his earlier
years when he published his <i>Morte D’Arthur</i>.
“He produced no epic, only a series of epic idyllia.
He had a spiritual conception, ‘an allegory in the
distance,’ an allegory not to be insisted upon, though
its presence was to be felt. No longer, as in youth,
did Tennyson intend Merlin to symbolise ‘the
sceptical understanding,’ or poor Guinevere to stand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
for the Blessed Reformation, or the Table Round
for Liberal Institutions. Mercifully Tennyson never
actually allegorised Arthur in that fashion.”<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>Tennyson’s King Arthur is certainly modern
enough in sentiment and speech, but the position
which he holds in the ‘Idylls’ is, in many ways, in
harmony with that which he occupies in history and
romantic legend. Tennyson himself warns his readers
that they must not expect to find in the ‘Idylls’</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent4">“that gray king whose name, a ghost,</div>
<div class="verse">Streams like a cloud, man-shaped, from mountain peak,</div>
<div class="verse">And cleaves to cairn and cromlech still; or him</div>
<div class="verse">Of Geoffrey’s book, or him of Malleor’s.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Rather they ought to discern in him</p>

<p class="center">“Ideal manhood closed in real man.”</p>

<p>All the same, Tennyson’s pre-occupation with
“ideal manhood” did not prevent him from bestowing
painful labour upon knowing the “real man,”
so far as the records, historical and romantic, reveal
him; and one of the outstanding features of <i>The
Idylls of the King</i> is their remarkable fidelity to
the details of Arthurian story as given in its time-honoured
literary sources. “Geoffrey’s book,” and
“Malleor’s,” had been carefully studied by the poet,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
and he had even been at pains to garner all he could
from early Welsh poetry and from the <i>Mabinogion</i>,
as presented in Lady Charlotte Guest’s charming
translation. While Malory is their main source, the
‘Idylls’ contain much that shows how familiar
Tennyson was with Arthurian lore generally in its
most primitive forms. The story of Geraint, for
example, as told by him, follows closely the Welsh
version of it given by Lady Charlotte Guest.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>
Again, the description of Britain in the opening lines
of <i>The Coming of Arthur</i> as a country where each
“petty king” was ever waging war upon some
other, and where the children “grew up to wolf-like
men, worse than the wolves,” until</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent8">“King Leodogran</div>
<div class="verse">Groan’d for the Roman legions here again,”</div>
</div></div>

<p>recalls vividly the bitter lamentations of Gildas over
the degeneracy of his countrymen. The account
which Lancelot gives of Arthur’s wars in <i>Lancelot
and Elaine</i> is an expansion of the record in Nennius
of the twelve Arthurian battles. And Tennyson’s
general conception of Arthur as the flower of kings
who</p>

<p class="center">“Drew all the petty princedoms under him,”</p>

<p>and “made a realm” in Britain, is far more in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
keeping with that of the early chroniclers than with
the picture given of him in the later romances.</p>

<p>But it is not in such incidental features alone
that the ‘Idylls’ are true to the older Arthurian
tradition. Modern in their sentiment and ethics
though they may be, Tennyson’s main purpose in
them of “shadowing Sense at war with Soul” is
not altogether unjustified by the general literary
history of the legends. Malory, at any rate, had
some such purpose, for Caxton assures us that the
<i>Morte Darthur</i> was “written for our doctrine, and
for to beware that we fall not to vice nor sin,
but to exercise and follow virtue.” “In Malory’s
compilation, and in later mediæval romance, the fate
of Arthur means the fate of the chivalrous ideal,
whose irreconcilable elements were incorporated
in him. In the romantic historians the fate of
Arthur is the fate of the Christian Britons in conflict
with heathenism from without and treason from
within. Even in the old myths, his fate, if we may
trust Professor Rhys, is the fate of the culture-hero
combined with Father Sky, in conflict with the
powers of Darkness and the Nether-world. It was
by a true inspiration that Tennyson was drawn to the
old legends, and reading into them his secret found
it to be their own. Accordingly, this identity of
feeling with his predecessors kept Tennyson on the
track of the story.... Thus the ‘Idylls’ are both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
truer to the authorities and nearer our own feelings
than any other of the adaptations of Arthurian
story. Though the adventures are now regarded
from a modern point of view, this point of view is
in the same spiritual watch-tower from which the
framers of the legend looked: but it is the platform
at the top, not a loop-hole on the winding
stair.”<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>After all, however much the ‘Idylls’ may be
cavilled at on the score of their modern sentiment
and occasional homiletic strain, their general setting
and atmosphere are genuinely romantic and in
thorough keeping with the far-off things of which
they sing. Tennyson is true enough to his sources
in his descriptions of scenery and in his entire survey
of the traditional Arthurian country. “It is no
land dwelt in by bold bad men we see, when Arthur
rides through the mountains and finds the diamonds;
when Geraint and Enid go through the green gloom
of the wood; when Galahad rides over the black
swamp, leaping from bridge to bridge till he sail to
the spiritual city; when Lancelot drives through the
storm to the enchanted towers of Carbonek seven
days across the sea.”<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> In none of the ‘Idylls’
do we perhaps breathe more of the atmosphere
of pure romance than in the first and the last.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
Mystery and magic surround both the coming and
the passing of the King;</p>

<p class="center">“From the great deep to the great deep he goes.”</p>

<p>This “weird rhyme” of Merlin’s comes into
Bedivere’s memory as he sees the barge with the
three dark Queens bearing Arthur away into the
distance</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent14">“till the hull</div>
<div class="verse">Look’d one black dot against the verge of dawn.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>And the last scene closes with the faithful Bedivere
left wondering whether Arthur will “come again,”
and whether, “if he come no more,” the three
Queens who bore him away be “friends of Arthur,
who should help him at his need?” So, Tennyson,
like Malory and the romancers, leaves Arthur’s
“return” an open question; but Bedivere goes
away comforted by what seemed an assurance that
“all was well” with Arthur whither he had gone.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Then from the dawn it seem’d there came, but faint</div>
<div class="verse">As from beyond the limit of the world,</div>
<div class="verse">Like the last echo born of a great cry,</div>
<div class="verse">Sounds, as if some fair city were one voice</div>
<div class="verse">Around a king returning from his wars.”</div>

<h2 class="nobreak">ADDITIONAL NOTES</h2>
</div>

<p><i>Note A, p. <a href="#Page_9">9</a>.</i>—The Grail and the Round Table, as originally drawn
into Arthurian story, were in all probability survivals of features
in old Celtic nature-worship.</p>

<p><i>Note B, p. <a href="#Page_26">26</a>.</i>—Cavall, it may be noted, is referred to in the Welsh
romance <i>Geraint, Son of Erbin</i>, as taking part in a stag-hunt under
the leadership of Arthur, and is there called “Arthur’s darling dog”
(<i>annwylgi Arthur</i>).</p>

<p><i>Note C, p. <a href="#Page_94">94</a>.</i>—Argante—afterwards known as Morgain, or Morgan,
<i>la fée</i> or <i>le fay</i>—is first heard of, in literature, in the poem called
<i>Vita Merlini</i>, commonly dated 1148 and ascribed to Geoffrey of
Monmouth (see p. 112). She there appears as a maiden, possessed
of magic powers, who heals Arthur’s wounds after the battle of
Camlan. Although she is usually spoken of by the romancers as
being Arthur’s sister, she is also represented as one who hates, and
is involved in certain malign schemes against, him. Her place in
Arthurian story is one of the many points at which the records and
popular legends of “the British King” touch the borders of fairy-land.
The fairy element in Arthurian romance is a fascinating,
albeit intricate, subject of study, but the scope and purpose of this
little book allow only the briefest references to it. Those who are
interested in the subject will find a very full, and suggestive, treatment
of it in <i>Studies in the Fairy Mythology of Arthurian Romance</i>, by Lucy
A. Paton (Radcliffe College Monographs, Boston, U.S.A., 1903).</p>

<p><i>Note D, p. <a href="#Page_101">101</a>.</i>—Chrétien himself, in the opening lines of <i>Cligés</i>,
states that he had written of “<i>le roi Marc et Iseut la blonde</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span></p>

<p><i>Note E, p. <a href="#Page_105">105</a>.</i>—Tristram, or Tristan, is the most accomplished of
all the heroes who are associated with Arthur. In the romances he
is pre-eminent as hunter, horseman, linguist, musician, harp-player.
He is also a liar of infinite resource.</p>

<p><i>Note F, p. <a href="#Page_115">115</a>.</i>—Malory, it should be said, is indebted for some
of his most picturesque touches in his account of the passing of
Arthur and of other incidents to an unknown English poet who,
probably in the fourteenth century, composed a metrical <i>Le Morte
Arthure</i>. As the first edition of the present book has been accused
of having done “grave injustice to our vernacular Arthurian literature
before Malory” through failure to recognise the merits of
“the unknown but most true poet whose rightful laurels have so long
been worn by the prose writer,” an extract from the poem may be
given in order to enable the reader to judge to which of the two,
from a purely literary point of view, the “rightful laurels” ought
to belong. Here is the poet’s account of the flinging of Excalibur:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">Why hast thou do so, thow false man?</div>
<div class="verse">Another bode thou muste me brynge,’” etc.</div>
</div></div>

<p><i>Note G, p. <a href="#Page_130">130</a>.</i>—It would be impossible, within the limits of such
a book as this, to pass in review all the English Arthurian literature
of the nineteenth century. William Morris’s <i>Defence of Guinevere</i>,
<i>King Arthur’s Tomb</i>, and other Arthurian poems doubtless breathe
much more of the primitive romantic spirit of the legends than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
Tennyson’s <i>Idylls</i>, but they are but slight experiments in comparison
with Tennyson’s elaborate design. Then there are other
works like Heber’s <i>Morte Arthur</i>, Lytton’s <i>King Arthur</i>, and Hawker
of Morwenstow’s <i>Quest of the Sangreal</i>, which claim a place in any
full survey of modern Arthurian literature, but are hardly of
sufficient importance to have required notice in so brief a chapter
as the last had, necessarily, to be.</p>

Rhys puts and answers the main question suggested in these pages
as follows: “How did Arthur become famous above other (Welsh,
or British) heroes, and how came he to be the subject of so much story
and romance? The answer, in short, which one has to give to this
hard question must be to the effect, that besides a historic Arthur
there was a Brythonic divinity named Arthur, after whom the man
may have been called, or with whose name his, in case it was of a
different origin, may have become identical in sound owing to an
accident of speech” (<i>A. L.</i>, p. 8).</p>

Zimmer (<i>Nennius Vindicatus</i>, Berlin, 1893). See, also, Fletcher
(<i>The Arthurian Matter in the Chronicles</i>, Boston, 1906) and M. R.
James (<i>Camb. Hist. of Eng. Lit.</i>, Vol. I. Ch. 5). Thurneysen
(<i>Zeitschr. f. Deutsche Philologie</i>, 1897) fixes 827 as the date of the

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_13" href="#FNanchor_13" class="label">[13]</a> This date must be accepted if we are to believe Nennius’s statement

index to edition of Welsh <i>Red Book</i>, text by Rhys and Evans, p. 342).
Among them is one Amlawdd, or Amlodd, who in <i>Kulhwch and
Olwen</i> is the father of Goleuddydd, the mother of Kulhwch, “a boy
of gentle birth and cousin unto Arthur.” In a poem ascribed to
Taliesin the deity even is called <i>gwledig</i>—“gwledig nef a phob tud,”
“ruler of heaven and of every land.”</p>

Maximus, in Welsh tradition suggests many points of analogy with

<p><a id="Footnote_47" href="#FNanchor_47" class="label">[47]</a> There are, of course, more than four “ancient books” in the Welsh
language—for example, the MS. of what is known as the Venedotian
code of the laws of Wales, and <i>The White Book of Rhydderch</i>, the
contents of which have recently been made accessible to Welsh
readers in Dr Gwenogvryn Evans’s fine edition. But Skene’s “four
books” contain all the oldest Welsh poetry that is of any account.
These four, named in chronological order, are known as <i>The Black
Book of Carmarthen</i> (twelfth century), <i>The Book of Aneirin</i>, <i>The Book
of Taliesin</i>, and <i>The Red Book of Hergest</i>.</p>

already referred to. Dr Gwenogvryn Evans, in the Preface to his
edition of <i>The White Book</i> ‘<i>Mabinogion</i>,’ without assigning to it so
definite a date, holds that <i>Kulhwch and Olwen</i> “is the oldest in language,
in matter, in simplicity of narrative, in primitive atmosphere,”
of all the tales to which the general name ‘mabinogion’ is given. Mr
Alfred Nutt, while holding that portions of <i>Kulhwch and Olwen</i> are of
“pre-historic antiquity, far transcending in age any historic Arthur,”
assigns the story in the form we have it to the twelfth century, on
the strength, mainly, of its affinities to eleventh century Irish sagas.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_74" href="#FNanchor_74" class="label">[74]</a> William of Newburgh, the severest of all Geoffrey’s critics,
writing about 1190, suggests that either this, or his own “love of
lying,” was the motive of the work. “It is manifest that everything
which this person wrote about Arthur and his successors, and his predecessors
after Vortigern, was made up partly by himself and partly
by others, whether from an inordinate love of lying or for the sake
of pleasing the Britons.” William also held that Geoffrey’s account
of events before the time of Julius Cæsar was either invented by
himself, or “adopted after it had been invented by others.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_77" href="#FNanchor_77" class="label">[77]</a> Where, apart from “the British book,” Geoffrey derived the name

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_79" href="#FNanchor_79" class="label">[79]</a> I have italicised the words “noble Roman family” here, because
this “Roman” descent of Guinevere would seem not to have been
derived from a Welsh source. In the Triads we read of a Guinevere
who is described as “the daughter of Ogrvan the Giant” (see <i>ante</i>,
p. 53). She is, apparently, the one among “the three Guineveres”
who is best known to Welsh tradition as the wife of Arthur. She is
mentioned both in a poem by the famous Welsh poet of the fourteenth
century, Dafydd ap Gwilym—referring to her adventure with Melwas—and
in an old Welsh rhyme, which gives her a somewhat disreputable
character (see Rhys, <i>Arthurian Legend</i>, Chap. III.).</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_80" href="#FNanchor_80" class="label">[80]</a> It is interesting to note, incidentally, that after the “solemnity”
at Caerleon, Dubricius is reported to have resigned his archbishopric,
and “David, <i>the King’s uncle</i>, was consecrated in his place, whose
life was an ensample of all goodness unto them whom he had
instructed in his doctrine.”</p>

Grail legend, see Miss J. L. Weston’s <i>The Legend of Sir Perceval</i> (2 vols.)
in the Grimm Library (Nutt). Miss Weston there distinguishes
three stages in the growth of the legend as “the Folklore, the
Literary and the Mystical.” In the Mystical, an element which she
holds to be “entirely foreign to the original tale,” viz., the Grail
quest, “modified and finally transformed it.” The folk-tale
“assumed an ecclesiastical and mystical character. The hero became
a champion of Christianity and Holy Church, and as such displayed
the qualities most approved by the religious views of the time:
he became not merely chaste, but an ascetic celibate, and any connection
with women was dropped altogether” (Vol. I. p. 117).</p>

one German, and the other English, French and American, being at
feud upon it. In connection with the alleged Welsh origin of some
of these traditions, it may be mentioned that the suggestion has
been recently made that the first collection of them for “romantic”
purposes was due to a Welshman variously known as Bledri, Bleheris,
or Bledhericus, who lived probably in the eleventh century, and is
spoken of by Giraldus Cambrensis as a ‘<i>famosus fabulator, qui

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
